### Install Your Blade and Flange
  1. Right click on the blade icon in the lower left corner of the screen and select 'Blade Change'.
  2. Open the dicing saw cover and place the interlock defeating key in the door interlock.
  3. Grab your blade/flange (with the grabbing tool or hand) and CAREFULLY place it onto the spindle. This should require very little force. If the flange doesn't easily slide onto the spindle please contact me immediately.
  4. Once you have installed your blade and flange onto the spindle you must secure it with the lock nut. To do this, line up any of the two holes on the lock nut with the two pins on the two piece torque wrench tool. Hold the back part of the wrench in place with one hand and turn the front part of the wrench clockwise with the other hand. Once the lock nut is hand tight you'll have to crank on the torque wrench until you hear a click. That should be the appropriate amount of torque to keep the flange on the spindle.
  5. From the 'Blade Selection' drop down menu, choose blade you just installed. If you are using a different flange diameter from the one selected in the software click the 'Change Flange' box and manually enter in the new flange diameter. Click 'Done' and then click 'Finish' in the lower left dialogue box.
  6. DO NOT STICK YOUR HANDS INTO THE SYSTEM! The saw will eventually start to rotate and go through its blade exposure measurement sequence.
  7. Once it says 'Blade change completed' inside the dialogue box you can check the three water sources.


### Adjust the Cut Water
  1. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL! The spindle is still rotating! Carefully pull the spindle cover lock to the left and open the spindle cover.
  2. Press the 'Water Adjust' to turn on the three different water sources. Verify that the Cut water is being forked by the blade (you should see a stream of water in front of the blade and one behind it). The Cut water should be hitting the blade/flange at approximately 7pm if the blade was a clock. If adjustments are needed, you can move the Cut water nozzle by holding the knob behind the nozzle with one hand and turning the top knob above counter clockwise. This will unlock the Cut water nozzle and give you free range of motion. Make sure you do not rotate the Cut water nozzle up into the blade! Once the Cut water looks good you can lock it in place by turning the top knob clockwise until it's tight.
  3. Verify that the flow rates of the Cut water, Clean jets, and Spray bars are 0.9 LPM, 0.8 LPM, and 0.8 LPM respectively. You can turn down the flow rates by adjusting the three small regulator knobs below the computer monitor. Just make sure to return the flow rates to their default values before ending your dicing session.
  4. Once the water situation looks good you can right click on the spindle speedometer in the top right of the screen and choose 'Operate'. This will turn the spindle off. Once the spindle has reached 0 RPM you can pull the interlock key and close the dicing saw cover.


### Initialize System
  1. After your initial blade change you must go to User =>System Init. This will initialize the chuck and saw and get the system ready to accept your sample.
  2. Once, the screen stops flashing yellow you can choose one of two routes. You can either create or load a recipe or load your sample.


### Create a Recipe
  1. To create a recipe, click on the book icon (Programming Workspace).
  2. In order to create a recipe in the software you must duplicate an old recipe. You can either duplicate a group/company member's recipe or open the 'RECIPES' folder on the left hand side of the software and select 'Recipe_APC'.
  3. Click 'Duplicate Recipe' and create a recipe name. Make sure you save your recipe in any other folder besides the 'RECIPES' folder. You can either find your folder by using the drop down menu or you can create a new folder name by typing into the 'Folder' box. Click 'Ok'.
  4. Five parameters you need to enter on your ""homepage"" are: blade (double click entry box to access drop down menu), wafer width and length (make sure orientation is correct if you're dicing a rectangular or elongated sample).
  5. Click on the 'General' tab on the top left part of the recipe window.
  6. Four parameters you need to enter are 'cut speed', 'overtravel', 'spindle speed', and 'height check rate'. For cut speed (how fast the saw travels across your sample), there are ranges developed here at UCSB which are posted on the wall to the left of the saw. As a general rule of thumb start on the slower side of the range and verify cut quality before turning up the speed. Overtravel is the distance the saw travels before each cut before it reaches your sample. This parameter prevents the saw from lowering directing onto the edge of your sample (which could potentially break the blade or crack the sample). We generally use an overtravel value of 7mm for any substrate 700um or less. Users dicing thicker samples should increase this value. Make sure you account for the curvature of the blade! Spindle speed is how fast the spindle rotates (kRPMs). Recommended spindle speeds are posted on the same sheet as the cut speeds. Height check rate is the amount of cuts the saw makes before it moves over the optical sensor to measure the exposure of the blade. The significance of this is that every time the system does an exposure measurement and your blade exposure decreases, the saw lowers to accommodate for the blade wear. If you allow for too many cuts in between measurements (i.e. this value is too high) you will notice that your cuts won't be going all the way through your sample. For harder substrates like sapphire or thick GaN you want the blade exposure to update every 1-2 cuts in order to stay up with the blade wear. For silicon you can turn this value up to 40 or more.
  7. Click 'Save'.
  8. Select 'Auto' => 'Define job'. Scroll down and find your recipe. Recipes are in alphabetical order based on groups. Click 'Apply' and then 'Ok'. Make sure your recipe shows up on the top of the software window!


### Load Your Sample and Align
  1. Click the 'Load Wafer' button (yellow arrow).
  2. Ensure that there are no large particles/debris on the chuck. It is recommended to use the DI and compressed air spray gun to clean off the chuck. If you hold down both the water and air buttons simultaneously the gun will act like a pressure washer.
  3. Load your tape frame and sample face up (tacky side up!) and slide the two notches of the tape frame underneath the two pin heads at the back of the chuck. There is a magnet in front of the chuck that will help hold the frame in place.
  4. Click 'Finish'. Watch your hands! The chuck will move underneath the camera.
  5. Click 'Manual Alignment' and follow the directions in the dialogue box on the left. There are three different magnifications (L, M, H). It is recommended to click on low (L) so you have a larger field of view.
  6. Use the 4 movement arrows to move to and select a right alignment point (double click on a feature to automatically move the green crosshair). Once you have selected your right alignment point click 'Next'. The camera will automatically move to the left side of your sample and prompt you to select a left alignment point. Make sure you select a feature in the same row as the one you selected for your right alignment mark otherwise you could cross align rows. Click 'Next' and your sample will be aligned to your two selected points. Click 'Finish' to complete alignment, click 'Next' to make adjustments to alignment marks.
  7. After finishing alignment you will be prompted to 'Define Cut Position'. This is the spot where the saw will first enter your sample. Your top most cut. Note: if you are dicing a full wafer or non rectangular piece make sure you define this cut position in X at the right most part of your sample. When you define this point every cut will start at this position in the X dimension. If you define this position at the edge of your sample where the diameter is smaller you will cause the saw to come down on your sample in areas where the diameter is larger.
  8. Click 'Finish' and a cut map of all your cuts will appear on the sample representation in the software (top left corner of the screen). Ensure that all the cuts are in the appropriate spots. To do this, move back over to the middle of your wafer or sample. Change the movement speed from 'Fast mode' to 'Index' by clicking on the 'F' in the middle of the four movement arrows until you see 'I'. Once you're in 'Index mode' every time you click the up or down of the movement arrows the camera will jump from cut to cut across your sample. Verify every cut position looks right. To make changes to the cut map, you will have to go back to the programming workspace and edit (and save) your recipe. Once you're done with the edit you must reload the recipe and click 'Manual Alignment' again. The camera should move to the original cut position. Click 'Finish' and the new cut map will appear.


### Manual Y-Offset
Before dicing your wafer it is recommended you do ""manual y-offset"". This is especially true if you look at the log book and the previous user brought in their own blade (a non 2.187 blade). This means that the cut street could be off by a couple millimeters in the y dimension from where you set it. 
To perform a manual y-offset, click the right eyeball icon (to the right of manual alignment). The software will prompt you to move to a ""single cut position and click next"". It is recommended you do this in two steps. For your first cut, move the camera somewhere above or below your sample (into the tape). This will prevent any damage to devices if the previous user created a large offset. Click 'Next' and the will prompt you to turn on the spindle (if it isn't on already). Once you click 'Ok' the saw will do one more exposure update and make a cut where you initially moved the camera to. Once the saw is done with the cut the camera will move back over it. If you do not see a cut on the screen you'll have to move the camera up or down to find it. Once you do see the cut, place the green crosshairs right in the middle of the cut street. You can click and drag the blue box for reference and also to measure the cut width. Once the green crosshairs are centered on the cut click 'Finish'. Your coarse manual y-offset will be completed. 
At this point your alignment can still be off by 5-10um because the tape will pull apart when cut which makes it hard to find the exact middle. If you want even better alignment click 'Manual y-offset' again and move somewhere on your sample without any important features or devices. Click 'Next' and the saw will make another cut. Now that it is cutting into something more rigid you'll be able to align the green crosshairs more accurately. 
### Cut Wafer
After completing your manual y-offset you are ready to cut. At this point you can do any final verifications on your wafer but as soon as you click the 'Wafer Full Cut' button (red wafer icon near the top right of the screen) the saw will start cutting. 
Final verification tip: Clicking the 'Wafer Full Cut' button during a cut will cause the saw to finish the current cut and then bring the camera back over it once it's completed. This is a good way of doing one last verification that the saw is cutting in the right position. This is not necessary and you should be fine as long as you previously verified your cuts after defining the cut position and you completed your manual y-offset alignment.

## About
### General Capabilities/Overview
The ASML 5500 stepper is a 248nm (KrF) DUV stepper for imaging dense features down to below 200nm and isolated line structures down to below 150nm (with effort). 300nm+ features are relatively ""easy"" to resolve. Layer-to-layer overlay accuracy is better than 30nm. 
The system is configured for 4” wafers. The system is designed for high throughput, so shooting multiple 4"" wafers is extremely fast, typically minutes per wafer, but any size other than 4-inch is difficult to work with (see below for more info). Additionally, exposure jobs are highly programmable, allowing for very flexible exposures of multiple aligned patterns from multiple masks/reticles in a single session, allowing for process optimization of large vs. small features in a single lithography. 
The full field useable exposure area is limited to the intersection of a 31mm diameter circle and a rectangle of dimensions 22mm x 27mm. Users have stitched multiple photomasks together with success. See the [Mask Making Guidelines page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ASML_DUV#Mask_Design_and_CAD_files) for more info on exposure field sizes and how to order your mask plates. 
#### Stepper Tutorial
If you are not familiar with how Stepper Litho is different from our lithography methods, please review this short tutorial: 
[**Stepper Reticle Layout vs Wafer Layout (Demis D. John)**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf) - Explains the following:

  * That a Stepper mask can have _many_ designs, and flexibly pattern the wafer with combos of designs.

AZ300MIF Developer for all processes 
Many of these DUV PR's are also able to be exposed with [EBL](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_Lithography_System_\(JEOL_JBX-6300FS\) ""E-Beam Lithography System \(JEOL JBX-6300FS\)""). 
### Part Size Limits
With staff support, mounted pieces down to 14mm in size can be exposed using a 4” wafer as a carrier. Flatness will typically be worse in this situation, so small <<500nm features will usually have bad uniformity across the mounted part due to focus variations. Edge bead on irregular pieces (eg. quarter-wafers/squares) will significantly reduce yield/uniformity. 
Multi-layer Alignment on mounted parts is particularly difficult, requiring either semi-permanent mounting to the carrier (eg. BCB, SU8 etc.) or significant difficulty/effort to re-align the part to the carrier wafer on each lithography (≤100µm re-mounting accuracy needed). 
At this time the maximum wafer size is 4” (100mm) wafers with SEMI standard wafer flat (not Notch).

  * Sample size: 100 mm wafers with SEMI std. major flat 
    * _Piece-parts process is possible but difficult - contact supervisor for info_
  * Alignment Accuracy: < 50 nm
  * Minimum Feature Size: ≤150 nm isolated lines, ≤200 nm dense patterns 
    * _To achieve ≤200nm features with high uniformity, we recommend wafers with total thickness variation (TTV) ≤5µm, and designing your CAD with a smaller Image Size for the high-res. feature_.
  * Wafer Thickness: Minimum ≈ 200µm, Maximum ≈ 1.1 mm
  * Maximum Dose: ~100mJ 
    * _Non-chemically amplified EBL resists are not permissible due to this limit._


### Maximum Wafer Bow
Measured over 90mm on the [Tencor Flexus](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Film_Stress_\(Tencor_Flexus\) ""Film Stress \(Tencor Flexus\)"")
  * **Do not run wafers with bow values higher than the following values** , contact supervisor for advice if needed.
  * Silicon wafers (~550µm thick): 100 µm will likely fail.
  * Sapphire (less pliable), ≥60µm bow will intermittently fail - DO NOT RUN 
    * This applies especially for GaN-on-Sapphire, which often have high wafer bow.
  * _Near these values, and you may lose the wafer inside the machine due to wafer vacuum error - DO NOT RUN if unsure._
  * _Substrate material and substrate thickness affect this limit - please contact[supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for advice._
  * You can **stress-compensate** wafers to reduce the wafer bow, eg. by depositing on the back side of the wafer. If your wafer is concave down, then depositing a _compressive_ film on the back will reduce its curvature. Coat the backside of the wafer with compressive PECVD SiO2 or [IBD SiN](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Sputtering_Recipes#Si3N4_deposition_.28IBD.29 ""Sputtering Recipes""), or other compressive films for concave-down bow.

### I-Line Photo-EBR Process
  * Spin/cure an I-Line photoresist using your standard photolith. params (for example [SPR 220-3](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_\(GCA_6300\) ""Stepper Recipes"")).
  * Don't load a mask plate.
  * Turn off ""Load Mask"" mode - you will likely need to confirm that no mask is present.
  * Place the wafer on the [MA-6 Contact Aligner](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Aligner_\(SUSS_MA-6\) ""Contact Aligner \(SUSS MA-6\)"") with the metal mask in place. 
  * You will use [Lamp Test] for the exposure. You can also use ""Flood Expose"" program and type in an exposure time.
  * Expose for about 3-2x longer than your normal exposure time.
  * Load wafer into your I-Line exposure tool & Expose your process
  * Run your PEB and Develop as per your normal process. 
    * (If you did not develop the EBR yet, it should go away in this step.)


### DUV Photo-EBR Process
  * Spin/cure a DUV photoresist using your standard photolith. params (for example [UV6](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28ASML_DUV.29 ""Stepper Recipes"")).
  * Place the wafer on the [**DUV Flood Exposer**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/DUV_Flood_Expose ""DUV Flood Expose"") with the metal mask in place. 
  * Turn on rotation on slow (so mask doesn't move), lamp warmup is not required.
  * Expose for 13 sec, with slow rotation.
  * _Optionally:_ PEB 135°C, 60sec, Develop, dry (in SRD), then proceed. This did not affect my primary lithography when I did this step separately. I've also done photo-EBR where I combined this EBR exposure with the primary Imaging litho. and only did a single develop.
  * Load wafer into ASML & Expose your process
  * PEB 135°C, 90sec
  * 300MiF develop as per your normal process. 
    * (If you did not develop the EBR yet, it should go away in this step.)

### Use Cases
This scripting capability is especially useful for very complex jobs - such as complex stitching wafer-layouts in which a _for()_ loop and some math can really help. 
For remote engineers that are routinely writing similar jobs with only minor changes (eg. new masks but otherwise similar layouts), this can be used to upload jobs to to the tool, which your local lab-users can then convert & run. 
### Caveats
The python script does not include all the error-checking that the ASML GUI contains, so brand-new or complex jobs will likely show some conversion error, which needs to be fixed (in your python script) and re-converted. In this case, you should bring the laptop you ran the Python script on with you, and fix errors and re-upload/convert until the job runs as expected. (Be sure to actually run a test exposure as well - some errors only pop up during exposure.) 
Some current limitations are listed in the 
### Required Files
  * Usage instructions and scripting files/examples are found on the GitHub page, here: 
  * The `Defaults.py` file for the UCSB ASML PAS5500/300 DUV Stepper is here: 
    * This is available only to authorized users of the UCSB ASML Stepper, and requires a UCSB Login.

### Instructions for Usage
  1. Contact [Supervisor for the ASML](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""), request to generate the JobCreator sub-folders on the ASML and on Nanofiles FTP.
  2. Use the above 
    1. You will get a plain-text output file like `Example01.txt`
  3. Log into Nanofiles SFTP, you will now see a new `JobCreator` subfolder, with a few subfolders: 
    1. [![screenshot of ASML JobCreator FTP Folders](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/6/67/ASML_JobCreator_FTP_Folders_01.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:ASML_JobCreator_FTP_Folders_01.png)
  4. Upload your *.txt file into the `incoming_TXT` folder. You can upload multiple files if desired.
  5. In the cleanroom, at the ASML:
  6. Right-click the blue Desktop to get a menu.
  7. **Right-** click the `(local)` menu, to show an additional menu.
  8. **Left-** click `JobCreator: Sync & Convert`
    1. A script will run and pop up, asking for the Group name.
  9. Type in your Group name & `<Enter>`
    1. The name must _Exactly_ match the folder name used on the ASML & Nanofiles, including capitalization.
    2. Remember the mouse must be over the script window to type.
  10. The script will do the following: 
    1. sync to nanofiles, to download your *.txt file to the ASML
    2. convert the *.txt file to a binary job file ready for exposure, placed inside the `<<GroupName>>/JobCreator` folder, and
    3. move your converted *.txt file into `completed_TXT/`
    4. sync again to push log files to the SFTP server.
  11. Check the Log Window for errors. 
    1. If your file was converted successfully, you should see a message like `ASCII job file 'jobs/users/<YourGroup>/<YourFile>.txt' **converted** to GNFH job file 'users/<YourGroup>/<YourFile>'.`
    2. If your file was **not** converted due to errors, you will see a message like: 
      1. `EVENT` `ASCII job file 'jobs/users/<YourGroup>/<YourFile>.txt' **not converted**, errors are logged in ER_event_log.``ASCII Job Creator ended, status: 2.`
      2. You need to scroll up in the Log Window and identify the error, and fix it in your job's python script, then reupload/convert etc.
      3. The last lines of the Log file are automatically copied into the FTP folder `asml/error-Logs/<YourFile>_<CurrentDate>.txt` so the errors are viewable via Nanofiles FTP.
      4. See the GitHub Issues page for common limitations, or send the error log to [Demis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for advice.

### Semi-Permanent Bonding to 4-inch carrier
### Temporary Water-bonded 4-inch Carrier
### Alignment Mark Locations
The optical prealigner requires prealignment marks to be ≥ 32.5mm radius from the wafer center. 
This allows wafers of 3-inch (75mm) and greater to have the marks located directly on the mounted substrate, greatly simplifying re/mounting. 
For smaller substrates (eg. 2-inch/50mm) the PreAlignment marks must be located separately on the 4-inch carrier, while the global alignment marks must be located on the mounted substrate. The complication is whether the relative position of the Carrier and Mounted parts' alignment marks change between lithographies.

### Resolution Test Charts
The Resolution test charts are repeated all across the reticle, in order to test for lens aberrations. You can have the system expose only a single resolution chart, but since they are placed closely together on the reticle, it's very likely that partial shots of adjacent charts will also be exposed. 
In addition, the repeating cells allow us to test for the proper `Dense_...` patterns are for calibrating the OPC algorithm, and are not for user analysis. 
_**Patterned area is CLEAR/transparent.**_
#### Calibration Chart Layout
Cell name is ""_UCSB_Cal_ "", with coordinates below pointing to center of this cell.

#### Coords for ""resolution_chart"" Calibration patterns
_Image coords for each of the ""resolution_chart_ORIG"" cells. You can pick just one of these for shooting a resolution test structure. The purpose of the many different locations is to check for variations due to lens aberrations. You could just choose one near the center of the plate to test your process, or you could choose a chart that is in a similar location as the pattern you're shooting on your mask plate._
_Note that some portion of the adjacent patterns will likely be exposed as well, due to the patterns not being surrounded by 1mm of chrome. Make sure you set your Cell Size large enough to make sure the bleed-over doesn't overlap with adjacent die._

ASML Stepper 3 Dicing Guide Programming,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ASML_Stepper_3_Dicing_Guide_Programming,"> _How to program the ASML DUV Stepper #3 to place dicing guides in between die._
```
UPDATE: doesn’t work: Ning tried this and found these patterns were too difficult to see on the disconfirm saw. Demis: new method, use ASML’s Alignment Mark distribution function to use SPM-X/Y marks as dicing guides. Carefully not to distribute too many - there is a software limit on number of exposures per Image. 

```

  * Determine a lithography step in the fabrication process during which the addition of dicing guides (crosses) would be acceptable and visible during dicing. There are both positive and negative versions of the Cross pattern.
  * When programming the job, add an new Image in `Wafer Layout > Image Definition` for the DicingGuides image, as so:

## Normal User Procedures
  *     * _BEFORE starting your job_ , check the **Warnings** window for any errors, and deal with them first. 
      * You may need to press the _[F4] Front_ keyboard key to bring the window forward.
      * See the ""[Errors: Warnings](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ASML_Stepper_3_Error_Recovery,_Troubleshooting_and_Calibration#Important_Warnings ""ASML Stepper 3 Error Recovery, Troubleshooting and Calibration"")"" section for how to deal with these.


  1. Cleaning the back-sides of wafers: **_Very important_**
    1. Make sure all work surfaces/spin chucks/hot plates are cleaned! Don’t use wipes, place baked wafers directly on cleaned steel surfaces.
    2. Cleaning residue of DUV42P or DSK101 (BARC’s): This technique is much better than trying to wipe. Use clean gloves and hold the wafer edges with your hands. 
      1. After spin coating, BEFORE baking, place wafer upside down in POLOS spinner using non-contact chuck. 
      2. Set spin speed to 2000rpm. Program “backside”.
      3. Spin wafer, wait until at top speed.
      4. Squirt “Remover PG” 10sec, then Acetone 3 seconds, then ISO for 3 sec.
      5. Spin Dry while blowing with N2. Wait ~5sec before stopping spin.
      6. Remove wafer and do bake as normal.
    3. Cleaning residues of DUV PR’s such as: UV210, UV6, UVN2300: 
      1. After baking, place wafer face-down in POLOS spinner using non-contact chuck.
      2. Set spin speed to 2000rpm. Program “backside”
      3. Spin wafer, wait until at top speed.
      4. Squirt Acetone on sample back for 3 seconds. Followed by ISO for 3 sec.
      5. Spin Dry while blowing with N2.
    4. Bring wafers and ASML cassette to Solvent bench, ensure surfaces are clean from solvents.
    5. Check back-side of wafer thoroughly for particulates before loading into system! If you see particulates, try to blow then off with high N2 flow first. You may need to get physical with a razor blade to remove stubborn particles. 
      1. Do this in the solvent bench where HEPA filters keep the air cleaner.
  2. Reticle Unloading and Loading 
    1. (Mat Hdl) Material Handler (button near top right of software window) 
      1. Remove reticles from machine
      2. Exchange reticle box
      3. Unlock box3
    2. Physically Remove desired reticle pod(s), green “3” indicator at box should be lit and all reticles should be lifted up into pod.
    3. Use manual box opener to open reticle box. Move arm slowly. 
    4. Remove Pod Lid
    5. Remove (or add) reticle to pod. 
      1. Two stars on reticle should be in front
      2. Chrome (dark) side down
    6. Place Pod lid back on
    7. Close Pod using arm, move arm slowly
    8. Place Pod back in stepper
    9. Read desired pods
    10. Go back to main menu once mask barcodes are all showing on screen
  3. Wafer Load 
    1. Open lid, Remove cassette
    2. (make sure backs of wafers are extremely clean! No Particles! No residues! Be extra careful and attentive to this detail! See above cleaning procedure) 
    3. Place wafers in slots
    4. Place cassette back. Make sure cassette is pulled back snugly in place
    5. Close Lid.
  4. Running a Job – Normal operation 
    1. Batch Control > Task Streaming
    2. Wait until wafers are read by machine
    3. Task: Batch > (Append)
    4. Enter Batch ID first, Hit Return to apply change
    5. Press Select Button under Job Name and navigate to your job
    6. Click on Layer ID to get a list of layers you can expose: Select layer you want
    7. Enter number of wafers in Batch Size
    8. Batch Type is “P” for production run (see below for doing a FEM)
    9. Verify Energy, Focus Offset, Ilumination Mode, NA, Sigma and change as desired
    10. Hit Action > (Apply) button to register all changes
    11. Press (Accept) Button at Top
    12. Press Queue > (Continue) Button to execute batch.
    13. If Batch has general failure: 
      1. Click the (HELP) button on error window and photograph the error chain - send to supervisor if needed.
      2. Choose “clear litho cluster” option to remove all wafers to output Port.


### Running a focus and/or exposure matrix
_Focus-Exposure Matrix/Arrays (FEM or FEA) are used to determine the proper exposure dose & focus offset for your lithography. Especially important for high-resolution layers. Make sure your entire litho process remains constant (spins, bakes, develop times etc.) between the FEA and your real sample lithos._
  1. _Optional_ : Copy you job to a new job file with the layers/images you want to shoot, but which does not fill the entire wafer to the edges - it instead has only a ~6x6-cm wide array of die (set in the _**Wafer Layout > Image Distribution**_ section of your program). This ensures that our SEMs can view the full array (The extreme edges of a 4-inch wafer are not possible to image on our SEMs due to motor limits) and simplifies calculations while inspecting the exposed wafer.
  2. Follow ""_Running a Job_ "" procedure above, until Step 7
  3. Under **Batch Type** : 
    1. Choose **E** for exposure snake (with flat down, first exposure lower left increments to the right, snakes in serpentine manner around entire wafer). Enter starting exposure in mJ (bottom-left die) and incremental exposure in mJ (increments up).
    2. Choose **F** for focus snake (with flat down, first exposure lower left increments to the right, snakes around entire array). Enter starting focus offset (bottom-left die) and incremental focus for the snake (increments up).
    3. Choose **M** for Focus-Exposure-Matrix (FEM). Center cell 0,0 is the nominal Exposure Energy and Focus value you enter. The array is incremented up and down from the nominal value. By default, exposure Energy varies by columns, Focus by Rows. See schematic below.
  4. Verify non-varied parameters as well as Ilumination Mode, NA, Sigma and change as desired.
  5. Hit **Action: (Apply)** button to register all changes 
    1. Check ALL the Images in the job! Use the **(Preset)** button to apply to all Images in the job.
  6. Press **Accept** Button at Top
  7. (optional) _Before_ running the exposure, click **Batch: (Report)** to view the exposure (dose/focus) distribution. 
    1. If you need to alter the FEM, close the report and choose **Batch: (Modify)** and ""**Overwrite report** "" when prompted.
  8. Press **Continue** Button to execute batch.
  9. When the batch is complete, select the batch in the Task ist, and click **Batch:** **(Report)**. The **""Test Exposure Data""** section of the report shows the exposure params for each die location. This is very useful during your inspection, and it is recommended that you bring a photograph or copy of this exposure matrix table with you when inspecting on the microscope/SEM.


#### FEM Array/Matrix Layout
_The below schematics show how the ASML PAS software arranges the varying Dose/Focus on a wafer. The layout is always calculated with respect to with the Cell at Column/Row = (0,0) in your program's Cell Layout._

---|---|---  
#### Tips for FEM analysis
You need to find the **center of the _Viable Process Window_** - meaning you need to see the BAD dose (too high + too low) and BAD focus (too high + too low) then choose a Dose+Focus in the _middle_ of this range. This allows your process to work even if the focus or some other process varies. 
You'll need to decide what ""good enough"" looks like on your feature inspection - this is your process _**tolerance**_. For example instead of looking for ""_the feature that is exactly 300nm wide_ "", you may want to look for Dose/Focus where ""_the feature is between 250-350nm, or 300nm±50nm_ "". Thus your process has a viable tolerance to normal fabrication variations. You may want to run simulations or other estimates for what the tolerance may be. 
A **common mistake is to look for ""_the best die_ ""** - but this one good die could be (and often is) at the edge of the working process window, so a small process variation (wafer thickness, hotplate temperature) will put your process outside the process window - you'll have chosen a very tight process that easily goes out of spec with random fluctuation in the process. 
##### General process:
  1. Run a ""Coarse"" (wide-range) Focus-Exposure Matrix using the ""starting params"" from the wiki for your PR/tool.
  2. Analyze (microscope or SEM) to find the edges of the process window in both Focus & Dose. Often this can be done somewhat fast by eye and optical microscope, without detailed measurements, allowing you to locate the center of the process window based on the obviously ""Bad"" rows/cols. 
    1. Tip: If possible, mark up your wafer with sharpie, scribes or other to make the grid easier to analyze, especially to avoid getting ""lost"" on the SEM.
  3. Run a ""Fine"" FEM with finer step size. 
    1. On the ASML, you can now keep the Focus constant according to the central Focus value from your Coarse FEM, and do only an Energy serpentine.
  4. Analyze to measure actual feature size, according to your process tolerance.

ASML Stepper 3: Wafer Handler Reset Procedure,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ASML_Stepper_3:_Wafer_Handler_Reset_Procedure,"_If the Warnings Window shows ""_ Wafer Handling not initialized _', or the Cassettes are not mapping (cassette may be partly lowered), or you opened the Port cover while robots were moving, you need to reset the Wafer Handler with the following procedure._
  

  1. _Queue > Clear,_ to clear the task list 
    1. do not proceed to next step unless Queue is cleared! Should say only “ _1-PAUSE_ ” in the task list
    2. If queue won’t clear, call supervisor! Requires full software reset.
    3. If you were not in “Task Streaming” screen already, proceed to next step.
  2. Exit to Main Menu with (_cancel_) & (_exit_)
  3. DON’T perform Fast Startup 
    1. always choose “ _Don’t perform startup_ ” if it asks!
  4. Lift black metal cover behind keyboard to expose the “hardware reset buttons”
  5. Press & hold BOTH “ _GLOBAL RESET_ ” buttons for 1-2sec then release 
    1. **_DO NOT leave the machine at this point!_** It is imperative that the system is not left in this state for more than a few minutes, or the temperature will drift, requiring hours of stabilization.
  6. The Warnings window will show “ _host xyz-8477 unreachable_ ” 
    1. you may need to use _[F4] FRONT_ keyboard key to show the warnings window, which is at the bottom of the screen
    2. wait until all “ _host unreachable_ ” warnings disappear. 
    3. should see “ _CT not initialized_ ” warning, and possibly a “ _reinitialize wafer handling_ ” warning.
  7. Choose _Startup/Shutdown > Startup (FULL) > START_
    1. All robots will reinitialize. Do not open port covers, as robots will be moving!
    2. When it is done, it will exit to previous screen
  8. Exit out to _Main Menu_
  9. _(Mat Hdl) material handler > Exchange Reticle Box > (Read All)_
  10. System is ready for use, exit to main menu and restart your job(s)

AZ5214 - Basic Process,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/AZ5214_-_Basic_Process,"AZ5214 is a positive PR to start. If you expose and develop, then the exposed areas develop out like a typical positive PR.

However if instead you expose, then post-exposure-Bake “PEB”, the exposed areas become Hardened/impervious to developer. But the rest of the PR is still unexposed. 
So THEN you flood expose the rest of the unexposed PR, and like a positive PR this now allows that PR to develop out.

  1. Open the ""AmScope"" software, via Desktop icon or Start-Bar icon: [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cd/AmScope_01_AmScope_Icon.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_01_AmScope_Icon.png)
  2. Set the microscope shutter to use the camera: [![photo of camera shutter on Nikon microscope](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/36/Microscope_4_Nikon_-_camera_shutter_-_IMG_6249_-_right_side_knobs_-_camera_shutter_-_800px.png/224px-Microscope_4_Nikon_-_camera_shutter_-_IMG_6249_-_right_side_knobs_-_camera_shutter_-_800px.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscope_4_Nikon_-_camera_shutter_-_IMG_6249_-_right_side_knobs_-_camera_shutter_-_800px.png)Camera shutter **Open** on Microscope 4 Nikon LS200, diagram showing to pull slider OUT for camera imaging.  

  3. Click the Camera in the software to begin acquiring images in the software:[![screenshot of software showing camera in Camera List](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Amscope_02_annot_camera_link.png/300px-Amscope_02_annot_camera_link.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Amscope_02_annot_camera_link.png)Click the link in the _Camera List_


### Camera Rotation
You _may_ turn the camera to adjust image rotation, but _do _not_ turn the camera more than 90°_, to prevent unscrewing/altering focus. 
You must put the camera back to 0° rotation when done (USB cable at the back). 
## Choosing the Calibration
In order for the software to know which objective you are using, you must choose the appropriately named Calibration from the dropdown lists. (eg. ""5x, 10x, 20x etc.""). Staff have set the software to display the Calibration/Objective name and microscope on the scale bar in the corner of the image. 
There are 2 separate ways to choose the calibration to use. 
### During live imaging
BEFORE snapping the image: 
On the bar right above the image window, use the drop-down menu called **Magnification** , which is used for measuring _live_ images. (This is also available from the top ""Options"" pull down menu). Choose the calibration from this list _during_ live imaging, **before** clicking ""Snap"". 
[![screenshot of top menu bar](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/3a/AmScope_-_02_annot.png/300px-AmScope_-_02_annot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_-_02_annot.png)The Magnification dropdown menu.
#### Capture the Image
Then, when the live image is ready, click **[Snap]** to capture an image. This image retains internal knowledge of which calibration was used during the capture, and is loaded into a new Tab. 
### After Image Capture
To change the calibration applied on an image that has already been captured, use the top menu bar item: 
Menu ""**Image** "" > ""**Resolution** "". Choose the correct calibration setting for the objective lens you were using and you will now have calibrated measurements for the still image. 
[![screenshot of popup window](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/94/AmScope_-_06_chose_mic2-150x_annot.png/434px-AmScope_-_06_chose_mic2-150x_annot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_-_06_chose_mic2-150x_annot.png)Menu item **Image > Resolution** popup window with scope calibrations dropdown.
## Saving an Image with Measurements
Perform measurements as desired using the various measurement tools (scale bars, line lengths etc.). 
If you want the measurements saved onto the still image, use the menu item: 
_**Layers** > **Merge to Image...**_ to merge the annotation layer onto the image. This will create a new image tab that has your measurements burned into it, the original editable tab is also still open. 
[![screenshot of menu item layers > Merge](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/90/AmScope_-_Layers_Merge_-_annot.png/300px-AmScope_-_Layers_Merge_-_annot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_-_Layers_Merge_-_annot.png)Menu item _**Layers > Merge to Image...**_ to burn the measurements into the image, before saving the image file.
The subsequent ""_**Export options**_ "" window allows you to choose the Font size for the text etc. ""50"" is typical. 
Save your pictures as jpegs as normal with _**File > Save As...**_. 
You can save all open tabs into a folder with automatic naming using **File > Batch Save**. 
## End Session
  1. Set the Camera shutter back to Eyepiece imaging (pushed IN) when done.
  2. Close all your image tabs in AmScope (_**Right-click**_ the ""Live"" tab and choose ""_**Close all but this**_ ""), or just close the software.

# About
These two parallel plate plasma etching systems are generally used to clean organic residue off of semiconductor wafers (ashing), etch organic films, or etch Si3N4 films. The systems are both equipped with O2 for organic removal / surface activation. 
One system also has CF4/O2 88% / 12% for etching Si3N4. These systems are operated manually and no sign-up is required. 
### Mechanism
This is a low-frequency RIE etch with O2 - using plasma ion bombardment, in a semi-vertical direction (although the higher 300mT pressure does attack sidewalls somewhat). The low kHz frequency allows ion to move with the RF, providing higher ion bombardment 
Low-temp (energy comes from ion acceleration, not temperature). 
### Applications
Use this for situation where the material to be removed is resistant to chemicals (fluorocarbon polymers - think ""plastic"") and/or relatively hard (chlorinated PR, after a CL2/BCl2 etch), so physical bombardment is necessary to break up the material, or if high-temp is not acceptable. Typical times: ~2min and microscope inspect and repeat. 
Stripping full-thickness PR's in the PEii is slow, at something like ~100nm/1min (at standard 100W/300mT). 
Surface activation, eg. making the surface hydrophilic before water-based wet-etching (15sec), or dehydration of wafer surface before HMDS application. This is very important for wet-etch processing through small, high aspect ratio photoresist holes or lines. 
Increase adhesion of the next deposition (~2-4min), for example right before loading into evaporator for lift-off. Etch is a bit more aggressive and will go through any monolayers (organic or otherwise), and possibly slightly roughen the surface

# About
The Bruker ICON AFM utilizes the latest paradigm in Atomic Force Microscopy - **PeakForce Tapping®,** a method that combines the best features of the legacy Contact Mode and Tapping Mode imaging techniques, namely direct force control and intermittent surface contact to reduce damaging lateral forces, to precisely control the probe-to-surface force interaction as pixel-to-pixel force curve measurements. This control results in the most consistent, highest resolution AFM imaging technique that can be used on a wide range of sample types. 
Note that the ICON AFM also can also utilize the legacy ContactMode and TappingMode techniques for imaging if required. 
In PeakForce Tapping®, the probe periodically taps the sample and the pN-level interaction force is measured directly by the deflection of the cantilever. Through superior force control, the feedback loop keeps the peak force constant, down to pN range, in both air and fluid, which is significantly lower than is typically used with other modes, such as TappingMode™, in the 1-10 nN range. PeakForce Tapping® enables the researcher to precisely control probe-to-sample interaction, providing the lowest available imaging forces. 
# Detailed Specifications
  * PeakForce Tapping® imaging for superior resolution and consistency
  * Legacy Contact Mode and Tapping Mode imaging also available
  * Substrate size range: small pieces (>2mm) up to 4"" wafers
  * Computer controlled XY stage for superior sample positioning; piezo Z scan range ~ 12um
  * Basic electrical measurement techniques are available but only using Contact Mode imaging. 
    * Scanning Capacitance Microscopy (SCM)
    * Conductive AFM (CAFM) for high currents, Tunneling AFM (TUNA) for low currents

# [Atomic Layer Deposition (Oxford FlexAL)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Layer_Deposition_\(Oxford_FlexAL\) ""Atomic Layer Deposition \(Oxford FlexAL\)"")
## Atomic Layer Deposition (aka ALD) - what is it?
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) utilizes sequential exposure cycles of 2 gaseous precursors to a substrate surface. Each half-cycle exposes one of the precursors to the substrate (and in the absence of the other) to ensure a ""saturated"" coverage on the surface. The saturation in exposure within each half-cycle leads to the self-limiting reaction behavior which defines an ALD process from other deposition techniques. With this in place, the deposition can proceed layer-by-layer with cycling and will result in uniform conformal growth over different substrate topographies. 
In most standard process, one half-cycle utilizes an organometallic precursor to deposit the metal of interest. The other half-cycle utilizes a counter-reactant to either oxidize or nitridize this metal to form the oxide or nitride film required. 
By nature of the deposition process, the reactions are slow. _Hence, users are restricted to 30 nm maximum thickness for all films when using the tool._ Any deviations from this requirement needs special permission (contact [Tool Supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Lingg ""Brian Lingg"") if needed). 
## Process Options
### Thermal ALD
In all ALD processes used in our lab, the organometallic half-cycle is always thermal, i.e., the precursor is exposed to the substrate as a vapor. In a fully thermal ALD process, the counter reactant half-cycle also utilizes gas exposure to the substrate. Because the intact molecules are less reactive than activated gases from a plasma, thermal ALD can be on the slower side. One advantage however is this lower reactivity means that the substrate itself can remain inert to the deposition process. 
### Activated ALD
#### Plasma
_**O***_ or _**N***_ in the recipe title means Oxygen or Nitrogen plasma, derived from flowing O2 or N2 gases through the ICP tube at the top of the chamber, respectively. 
The plasma processes on this tool will run considerably faster than purely thermal processes, because the ions/radicals formed are significantly more reactive (which can be a drawback if depositing on a sensitive substrate). Note that the O* plasma can also reduce carbon contaminants from the organic precursors when forming oxide films. When growing nitride films, H2 is often added to the nitride-plasma gases to generate H* ions/radicals which can assist with the removal of C within the film. 
#### Ozone
_**O3**_ in the recipe title refers to an oxidation reaction that uses an external Ozone generator for oxide growth (InUSA, Series 5000). Ozone is a more reactive form of oxygen than O2 that can be used to generate oxide films in a more thermal manner than plasma. 
Note that the generator must first be turned on prior to running any ozone-based recipe. Clicking on the O3 Generator icon on the tool desktop will open the control window. Both the O2 flow and the O3 concentration should be set to the defaults of 250 sccm and 19 wt% in the field settings. Clicking on the ""Start Generator"" button will start the ozone generator running. Wait for about 5 minutes for the system to stabilize. When done, _always_ be sure to click on the ""Stop Generator"" button to turn off the generator and stop the O2 flow - it is very important not to forget to do this as the source could be burned out and/or the O2 bottle supplying the generator could be depleted if it runs too long! O2 will remain flowing for an additional minute to flush out any residual O3. Once that is completed, you can close the window. Check with [supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Layer_Deposition_\(Oxford_FlexAL\) ""Atomic Layer Deposition \(Oxford FlexAL\)"") for further details. 
## Chamber #1: Conductive Films
```
Chamber 1 utilizes a dual manometer system that allows higher pressures during deposition than chamber 3.  For example, chamber 1 has an upper limit of 2000 mTorr whereas chamber 3 has an upper limit of only 240 mTorr.  The higher pressures allow the use of less reactive organo-metallic precursors to effect ALD growth in a reasonable time-frame.

```
```
**Maximum 30nm deposition thickness for all processes in chamber 1! Any depositions outside this maximum are prohibited unless discussed first with the** Tool Supervisor[](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Lingg ""Brian Lingg"").

## About
The Loomis LSD-155Lt is a production scribe and break system that can be used for processing large grids, arrays of laser bars, cleaving high quality mirror facets, and dicing wafers. 
## Detailed Specifications
  * Maximum Wafer Size: 4""
  * Parts mounted to low tack tape and used in conjunction with 6"" plastic rings.
  * Automated cut maps at multiple angles (0° and 90° typical)
  * ~few micron alignment to on-wafer features.
  * Multiple scribe and cleave options including 'scribe and break', 'notch and cleave', and 'peck and cleave'.
  * Users should try and follow the 3 to 1 ratio (distance between cleaves should be 3X the thickness of the substrate) although some material like InP and GaAs can occasionally be cleaved closer to 2 to 1. 
    * Thinning the substrate allows for much easier cleaving and cleave lines closer together.

## Stepper Mask Tutorials
If you are new to stepper masks, please see these tutorials before starting your design.
[![Schematic of stepper blocking off adjacent Images on reticle and exposure onto different wafer locations.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/0b/Stepper_Reticle_Tutorial_-_Reticle_Masking_Schematic.png/300px-Stepper_Reticle_Tutorial_-_Reticle_Masking_Schematic.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)**[Click for Stepper Reticle Tutorial](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)** Stepper Reticle Patterns (“images”) can optionally be much more sophisticated and flexible than contact plates.
  * **[Stepper Reticle Layout vs Wafer Layout (Demis D. John)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)** _-_ explains how Stepper mask layout is very different than other litho systems.
  * **[Stepper Reticle Layout (Advanced) - Complex Experiments and Variations](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Reticle_Layout_\(Advanced\)_-_Complex_Experiments_and_Variations ""Stepper Reticle Layout \(Advanced\) - Complex Experiments and Variations"")** - If you need many design variations on your wafer.


## Photomask Ordering Info
  * Plate Material: Soda-Lime or Quartz / Chrome
  * Dimensions: 5"" x 5"" x 0.090""
  * Magnification: 5x (assuming CAD file shows on-wafer patterns)
  * Right Reading if Chrome is Down (assuming CAD file shows on-wafer patterns)
  * Barcode is optional, but recommended. Max number of characters for GCA barcodes is 10
  * Instruct vendor that design is for a ""_**GCA AutoStep200 with 5x reduction**_ "".
  * You can insert your design into the photomask template yourself (below) with no barcode, or ask the vendor to insert your 1x (wafer-scale) design into the appropriate GCA template and they can add a barcode.
  * **[Photomask Ordering Procedure for UCSB Users](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photomask_Ordering_Procedure_for_UCSB_Users ""Photomask Ordering Procedure for UCSB Users"")** - see this page for how to submit your order into the purchasing system. 
    * Request our negotiated quote (for ACADEMICS ONLY) from [Demis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") or [Brian](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"").


## Submission Details
When submitting the photo mask order, the following notes/definitions apply: 
  1. ""_Grade_ "" determines the price, and is chosen based on required feature size (smaller feature size is more expensive). This is found on the vendor's quote, or you ask the vendor for a price based on desired minimum feature size. Although you will submit your CAD file at 1x wafer scale, the actual reticle is printed 5x larger, so make sure to choose your reticle grade accounting for this; eg. If I want to shoot 1.0µm lines, I should choose a photomask grade better/equal to 5.0µm.
  2. “ _GDS Level_ ” is the “layer number”
  3. ""_topcell_ "" is the name of the Cell in your CAD file that contains the hierarchy of patterns to print.
  4. Typically printed ""_Right reading (legible) with Chrome Down_ "", if your CAD is exactly what you want on the wafer.
  5. “ _Min. Feature on Mask_ /Lines” refers to minimum clear or chrome feature, assuming features similar to lines/spaces. See ""_Grade_ "" above.
  6. “ _Min. Contact_ ” refers to features with aspect ratio close to 1:1, eg. Squares and circles. These have a separate spec due to the manufacturing process, so make sure to choose the appropriate grade of photomask with this in mind.
  7. Choose a Critical Dimension “ _CD_ ” similar to your most critical feature (scaled up to the reticle scale), so they will print & measure & guarantee test structures at that size.
  8. For UCSB purchases: you will need to submit your order in UCSB Procurement Gateway _**first**_ (as a ""_Non-Catalogue Item_ ""), with the cost estimate & grade/product code from our negotiated quote, so that you can get the Purchase Order (PO) Number. Then submit the order form to the photomask vendor with this PO number entered on their order form.


## Mask Layout
  * Maximum exposable single-image size: 14.8 x 14.8 mm at 1x wafer-scale (74mm square at 5x reticle-scale). Photomask vendor can accept up to max. 78mm X 78mm @ 5x reticle-scale.
  * For multiple Images (patterns) per photomask mask: ≥1mm @ 1x wafer-scale / ≥5mm @ 5x mask-scale of chrome in between adjacent Images/patterns.
  * For multiple Images per photomask, you'll need to calculate the distance, in mm, for the shutter blade positions to block off the unwanted regions of the mask. 
    * There are 4 shutter blades, **XL(left)/XR(right)/YF(front)/YR(rear)** , that start at _Position=0mm_ (not blocking any part of the mask), and can extend up to _Position=97mm_ , blocking the entire mask. For the first 13mm (_Position = 0→13mm_), nothing is blocked on the 14.8mm exposure field.
    * Remember that the photomask is rotated 180° from how it's loaded into the reticle box.


## Alignment Marks (Global, Local/DFAS)
To learn more about how these alignment marks work with the system, see the reticle handbook here: 
  * [**GCA Reticle Handbook**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/uploads/2023/GCA-ReticleHandbook.pdf)


In our system we mainly use manual global alignment to get +/- 0.25 or better alignment tolerance. Local alignment can be used but needs some characterization for each process. 
  * _Global alignment marks_ : These marks and how to place them on the mask are described on page 5-44 to 5-47 of the above GCA Reticle Handbook and are included for download below. The difference of our system from the manual is that the objectives are 63.5 mm apart, not 76.2 mm as indicated in the manual. The distance of this mark (or marks) to the center of the cell in X and Y should be noted, this is the _key offset_ and will be required when exposing a job. (Positive offset values are left ← for X and up ↑ for Y).
  * _Local alignment marks_ : Uses Digital Fine-Alignment System (DFAS). These marks and how to place them on the mask are described on page 5-33 to 5-34 of the above GCA Reticle Handbook and are included as an attachment to this document. If possible use one of each type if you desire to try to use local alignment. These can be light or dark field in nature. The distance of the center point of this mark (or marks) to the center of the cell in X and Y should be noted, this is the key offset and will be required when exposing a job.
  * [Alignment Marks CAD File](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/9/92/GCA_Global_Mark.gds) can be downloaded here.


### Test Structures
  * _Vernier Scales:_ These can be included to quantify the alignment offset after an exposure is done. The reticle handbook has an example of vernier scales on pages 5-49 to 5-53. You should include them for any layers that require critical alignment.
  * _Resolution:_ If you have room in the mask layout, it is good to have features that can give the resolution of a given exposure. The resolution should show both “pillars” and “trenches” in the resist so that you can see whether the focus or exposure needs some tweaking for your particular process.


## CAD Files
  * [Photomask Template: Dark-field (polygons/objects are clear) at 5x Magnification (GDS)](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/c4/GCA_Stepper_MaskPlate_Master-DarkField_5x.gds)
    * _This template is designed to be submitted to the photomask vendor to print as-is, no scaling nor outer template applied - it is already at 5x magnification and has the GCA's reticle-alignment marks to align the mask to the lens column._
    * _Insert your wafer-scale designs into the template as Instances scaled UP by 5x (using the Instance Properties)._
    * _Template is written for ""objects/polygons are CLEAR"" aka. ""Dark Field"" - choose your design polarity accordingly._
    * Use the Cell ""**Reticle_Align** "" or ""**Reticle_AlignFlat** "" (flattened version of the same), GDS **Layer 42/0**.
    * _Your device cell should have center of die at (0,0), and instance it into the template with coords (0,0), for a single-design centered on the plate._
  * [GCA Alignment Marks CAD File](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/9/92/GCA_Global_Mark.gds) can be downloaded here. 
    * _You can optionally include these in your die, allowing the system to perform_ Local alignment _in addition to std. Global alignment._
    * _The AutoStep200 also has a system mask with this mark, which you could optionally use to shoot marks on the wafer._
  * See [Calculators + Utilities > CAD Files](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities#CAD_Files_.26_Templates ""Calculators + Utilities"") for other useful CAD files, such as Overlay/Alignment and Resolution measurement.

# Troubleshooting
Most of the errors are listed on the paper that is attached to the tall cabinet. Here are the most common ones: 
### What to do in case of computer (monitor) freeze-up
Please try these things in this order. 
  1. Try CTRL C followed by A and Enter. This will abort any command that may have hung up. Fallow instructions ( tall cabinet, printed paper on the wall)
  2. For Reticle Robot Hang Up: See step 25 of start-up procedure


### What to do in case of unplanned power outage.
  1. CR Staff will take care of the system in the morning.


### What to do for an alignment error
  1. Verify that correct alignment key offset is being used (check sign convention)
  2. Verify that correct pass shift is being used (check sign convention)
  3. If you have DFAS alignment marks, perform a MAP job to verify alignment ( check sign convention)


### What to do for focus resolution problems
  1. Perform a focus (EXPO) job using the same type of wafer that you will use for your real job and use the optimal focus offset determined from this job. You may need to look at both exposure time and focus.
  2. If you have been running the same process and now have issues, run SETUP from the : prompt, following the instructions on the GCA Regular Maintenance Sheet.
  3. Verify that you are using correct chuck for a substrate that you are exposing (each chuck has a specific thickness)


### What to do in case of the stage limit going too far
  1. Red stage limit light will be lit inside the stepper chamber next to the joystick.
  2. Press the lit limit switch (lower left corner in the environmental chamber) to release the stage.


### What to do if you cannot undo the problem or need some help
  1. contact [Biljana Stamenic](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Biljana_Stamenic ""Biljana Stamenic""): if it is job related or need some help in using the tool

## About
This is an Oxford Instruments PlasmaLab 300 IBE/RIBE/CAIBE system used for ion beam etching of a variety of materials including metals, oxides, semiconductors. Ion beam etching (IBE) allows control of sidewall etch profiles by tilting and rotating the sample during the etch. Reactive chemistry (""Chemically Assisted Ion Beam Etching"", CAIBE) can be used, when appropriate, to enhance the etch rate of materials, such as oxides, polymers, and semiconductors. 
This system is used to physically ion beam etch noble and inert metals with Ar ion milling, and to etch other materials that react with chlorine, fluorine, or oxygen using a reactive ion beam. The ion beam is generated in a 15cm diameter 3-grid ion source manufactured by Oxford. The Ion beam voltage & current control the etch rate. Beam voltage (related to ion energy) affects the sputter yield (atoms etched per incident ion) and Ion beam current controls the flux of ions (number of ions in the beam). Etch rate should be roughly linear with beam current. Neutralizing electrons are generated by a plasma bridge neutralizer (PBN) so that samples are not charged by ions during the etch. Samples can be cooled to 5°C or heated to 300°C for etching. He back-side cooling is used to transfer heat from(to) the sample to(from) the cooled(heated) platen. 
### Cluster Configuration
The Ion Mill system is clustered with 2 Oxford ALD systems, allowing the process flexibility of etching followed by ALD passivation or metalization without breaking vacuum. 
  * Chamber #1: [ALD Metal Films only](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Layer_Deposition_\(Oxford_FlexAL\) ""Atomic Layer Deposition \(Oxford FlexAL\)"")

## CAD Layout and Mask Design
### CAD Layout Programs
_Use these for designing your lithography mask plates._
#### L-Edit
Powerful multi-layer layout program. Sophisticated object instantiation and array layout, to reduce files sizes and easily push changes to multiple cells. 
  * UCSB's ECE dept. provides an **academic** license for this software (no industrial users!), email 
  * Windows only.
  * See [this **L-Edit Tutorial**](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Images/uploads/2018/LEdit_GettingStarted_CherryGupta.pdf) for a good starter guide. Written by [Prof. Sumita Pennathur](https://me.ucsb.edu/people/sumita-pennathur).


A free, open-source, and fast/simple CAD tool for mask/reticle layout. Also has powerful functions, DRC, scriptiable and can handle very large files (GB's) efficiently. 
Download at 
  * Available on Windows, Mac or *Nix.
  * Fast viewing of layer overlay, overlay multiple files, cell hierarchy, large (>1GB) files etc.
  * Supports the same core functionality as L-Edit - hierarchical Cell Instances, arrays, programmable Cells (PCells) etc.
  * Scriptable with Python or Ruby, with decent tutorials.
  * [_**KLayout Design Tips**_](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips ""KLayout Design Tips""): important info on making ""valid"" CAD files, and setting up the program for efficient use.
  * Univ. of Waterloo QNFCF has produced some good 


  * Free editor for GDS, OASIS, DXF etc. available on Windows, MacOS, Linux.
  * Scriptable with Python, Ruby, C++


#### AutoCAD
Many photomask vendors can accept AutoCAD DWG files, but these can only be opened in AutoCAD (not KLayout or other layout programs). Although AutoCAD can produce a cross-compatible DXF file, we see many design/conversion issues with these files. This is because many shapes and line-types (Curves and Line/polyline/LWLine for example) used in AutoCAD don't convert as expected into the polygons needed for printing. Also the DXF file format itself often creates problems, such as incorrect scaling (undefined units: mm or µm?) or badly-filled/unclosed polygons. 
### CAD Design Tips
##### _Cells and Instancing_
All major chip layout programs support ""Cells"" and similar structures for hierarchical layout. It is highly recommended that you understand and use the concept of ""Cells"" in your design. This circumvents many problems with enormous file sizes (due to huge numbers of identical polygons), and if used properly, helps tremendously with programming the Stepper lithography machines. Links to documentation below: 
  * Create a new cell, and instancing that cell: 
  * Viewing only some levels of the heirachy, to prevent drawing all objects: 


##### _File Types_
OASIS files tend to be much smaller than GDS files, and they also save the Layer Names (not just number). Alternatively, in KLayout the function **File > Save Session** will save the entire view including layer styles and window/zoom locations will be saved. You can share this file, as the entire design file is embedded within it, but it may not be as robust between KLayout versions. 
DXF Files can often cause problems because the format varies widely depending on the program they are exported from. For example, DXF can lose the ""scaling"" causing polygons to be 1000x larger than expected, or unexpectedly cause some shares to get filled in. 
##### [_KLayout Design Tips_](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips ""KLayout Design Tips"")
See the above page for important info on making ""valid"" CAD files, and setting up KLayout for efficient use. 
##### _Handling very large files_
If you will be generating millions of identical shapes (eg. repeating array of circles), the file size can quickly become enormous due to all the stored polygon points. You can reduce the number of polygon points stored by: 
  1. Reduce the number of points in each shape/circle if possible.
  2. Use Cell instancing so that only one, or a few, polygons are defined, and that same polygon is then only referenced as a repeating Cell instance. (See above for tutorials).
  3. The OAS file type generates much smaller files, and most photomask vendors can accept this. Photomask vendors are used to handling large files.
  4. Photomask vendors are able to take multiple files and insert them into the final reticle – you just need to provide a clear schematic showing the exact insertion coordinates for each file (with respect to the origin of each file). They can also do some boolean operations (for a fee).


### Example CAD File
Here is an example CAD file, showing the use of Layers and Cells, designed in KLayout. The device is fictional, for illustrative purposes only. 
  * [CAD_Tutorial_for_Reticle_v1.OAS](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/a/ae/CAD_Tutorial_for_ASML_Reticle_v1.OAS) , or [GDS version](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/0/0f/CAD_Tutorial_for_ASML_Reticle_v1_GDS.gds ""CAD Tutorial for ASML Reticle v1 GDS.gds"") (_Demis D. John_)
  * Cell ""**Device_Layout** "" shows a single device, with each _Layer_ overlaid as it would be in a fabricated device. Each Layer (eg. a ""process step"" such as Mesa etch, Pad Metal etc.) is placed into it's own Cell.

    [![screenshot of KLayout view of Device_Layout](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/97/CAD_Tutorial_for_ASML_Reticle_v1_-_screenshot_Device_Layout_cell.png/530px-CAD_Tutorial_for_ASML_Reticle_v1_-_screenshot_Device_Layout_cell.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:CAD_Tutorial_for_ASML_Reticle_v1_-_screenshot_Device_Layout_cell.png)""Device_Layout"" Cell showing as the ""top cell""
  * Every Cell's _Origin_ (0,0) lies on top of one another in the final _Device_Layout_. 
    * One way this can be accomplished is by selecting the objects/polygons you want to make into a new Cell, then use the function **Edit >** **Selection > Make Cell**, and _uncheck_ the ""_Put Origin at..._ "" checkbox, so the new Cell maintains the same origin as the original view.
  * The Cell ""**Reticle_Layout** "" can be exported by itself (right-click the Cell name), for sending to the photomask manufacturer. 
    * [Here is an example GDS file (download)](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/3/34/DEMISJAN2020_-_Reticle_Layout_v1.GDS) for submission to the photomask manufacturer, with all objects moved to a single Layer.
  * See the [Stepper Mask Making Guidelines page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Mask-Making_Guidelines_\(Generic\) ""Stepper Mask-Making Guidelines \(Generic\)"") for an example of how to program this Reticle into an ASML Stepper job.


#### Advanced Stepper Mask Layout
  * [CAD_Tutorial_for_ASML_Reticle_v2_DEMIS-DOE.OAS](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/2/23/CAD_Tutorial_for_ASML_Reticle_v2_DEMIS-DOE.OAS ""CAD Tutorial for ASML Reticle v2 DEMIS-DOE.OAS"") - example CAD file for reticle with many design variations. 
    * Cell ""_**Reticle_Layout**_ "" shows the mask that would be printed by a photomask vendor. You would print **Layers 1,2 and 3** onto a single mask plate, with the CAD file origin at the center of the mask plate (no automatic centering).
    * Cell ""_**Wafer_Layout**_ "" shows an estimation/""simulation"" of design variations to be exposed on the wafer. It is only a ""simulation"" because the real layout would be programmed on the Stepper tool itself, which may make changes (such as automatically filling to the wafer's edge).
  * [ASML_Reticle_Programming_Params_-_DEMIS-DOE_v1.xlsx](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/5/56/ASML_Reticle_Programming_Params_-_DEMIS-DOE_v1.xlsx ""ASML Reticle Programming Params - DEMIS-DOE v1.xlsx"") - stepper programming sheet for the above CAD file, for typing in the mask's _**Images**_ into the Stepper software.

# About
The Logitech Orbis system is used in the facility for fine-scale polishing and planarization of a variety of materials including glass, silicon, GaAs, InP, GaN, etc. Wafers up to 6” diameter can be polished on the system. 
Several slurries and pads are available to provide a range of polishing options depending on the material being processed. Pieces can also be handled on the system by wax-mounting with the [Logitech Bonder](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wafer_Bonder_\(Logitech_WBS7\) ""Wafer Bonder \(Logitech WBS7\)""). 
Each process is often unique in geometry and material combinations so that independent process development is required for most CMP applications.

## About
This system is a dual-use mask aligner and wafer-bond aligner, used for contact and proximity exposure processes. System is motorized for contact/proximity, microscope objective movement and exposure, with a computer used to display the microscope image for regular and backside alignment overlay. Exposures can be performed with gaps programmable from 10 um to 300 um in 1 um increments. Automatic wedge error compensation (WEC) is used to ensure that the mask and wafer are parallel. The lamp is a 350 W Hg-Arc lamp, providing significant power in the g-h-and i-line regime. Integrated light level sensing ensures proper exposure doses as the lamp degrades. 
Lithography can be performed on wafers from 2” to 6” in diameter. Piece parts are better handled on the [MJB-3 aligners](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Suss_Aligners_\(SUSS_MJB-3\) ""Suss Aligners \(SUSS MJB-3\)""). 
The system is fitted with visible, motorize, bottom-side optics for back-side alignment capability. Backside alignment is performed with an automated image capture system, at 5x, 10x, or 20x magnification. The backside alignment system takes images of the photomask from the _underside_ , then overlays that image digitally with the wafer face-down, again aligning with the cameras on the underside. 
Bonding alignment can be performed on 3” to 6” wafers. The bond alignment is performed with special fixturing to allow aligned samples to be transferred to the [Karl-Suss SB6 system](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wafer_Bonder_\(SUSS_SB6-8E\) ""Wafer Bonder \(SUSS SB6-8E\)"") - contact the supervisor beforehand so the bond alignment fixturing can be installed.

# Notes
Below is a listing of contact lithography recipes for use with designated aligners. 
Based on your sample reflectivity, absorption, and surface topography the exposure time parameters may vary. This listing is a guideline to get you started. 
For best resolution using thin resists, you will need to remove any edge bead before contact and exposure. This can be done with a razor blade (not for brittle substrates), or EBR-100 on a cotton swab (wipe off excess liquid before using), or lithgraphically with a tin-foil mask, flood exposure and develop. 
Also, hard contact mode will give you the most intimate contact between sample and mask, giving the best resolution. However for flat unpatterned substrates, this can cause wafers to stick to the mask plate. 
Post develop bakes (not listed, aka. ""hard bake"") are used to make the resist more etch resistant and depend on subsequent processes. Unless otherwise noted, all exposures are done on silicon wafers.

## Positive Resist (MJB-3)
Unless otherwise noted, bakes are on hot plates and the exposure of the resist is done using no filtering at 7.0 mW/cm2. Only Channel @2 is used/calibrated. Power of the lamp is set using the 405 nm (h-line) detector.

## Negative Resist (MJB-3)
Unless otherwise noted, bakes are on hot plates and the exposure of the resist is done using no filtering at 7.0 mW/cm2. Power of the lamp is set using the 405 nm (h-line) detector. In general, many negative resists require post-exposure-bakes (PEB) / flood exposures in order to make the negative tone of the image. All flood exposures are done in broadband light using any contact aligner. Also, because the tone is negative, a shorter first exposure time will result in more undercut, which is desirable for single-layer lift-off processes. Under these conditions more develop time will also give more undercut.

## Positive Resist (MA-6)
Unless otherwise noted, bakes are on hot plates and the exposure of the resist is done using no filtering at 9 mW/cm2 (Channel 1). Power of the lamp is set using the 365 nm (i-line) detector. For reference, this would equate to 17.5 mW/cm² when measured with a 405 nm (h-line) detector. 
For the MA-6 aligner, using Channel 1, the exposure times given below are the same as the MJB-3 except they have been reduced by a factor of 2.4.

## Negative Resist (MA-6)
Unless otherwise noted, bakes are on hot plates and the exposure of the resist is done using no filtering at 9 mW/cm2 (Channel 1). Power of the lamp is set using the 365 nm (i-line) detector. For reference, this would equate to 17.5 mW/cm² when measured with a 405 nm (h-line) detector. 
In general, many negative resists require post-exposure-bakes (PEB) / flood exposures in order to make the negative tone of the image. All flood exposures are done in broadband light using any contact aligner. Also, because the tone is negative, a shorter first exposure time will result in more undercut, which is desirable for single-layer lift-off processes. Under these conditions more develop time will also give more undercut. For the MA-6 aligner, using Channel 1, the exposure times given below are the same as the MJB-3 except they have been reduced by a factor of 2.4.

## About
The Si DRIE system is a Plasma-Therm DSEIII series system with a loadlock, intended for Standard

(Image Credit: Demis D. John, Jul. 2021)
The fixturing is configured for 4"" diameter Si wafers and uses a clamp to hold the wafer on the RF chuck. Smaller pieces are placed on a 4-inch wafer carrier for etching. 
[![SEM of 10µm deep bosch etched trenches](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/c/ce/DSEiii_Example_Bosch_Etch_02.jpg/300px-DSEiii_Example_Bosch_Etch_02.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:DSEiii_Example_Bosch_Etch_02.jpg)Example of 10µm deep Bosch etch, showing horizontal striations from each etch cycle. (Image Credit: Biljana Stamenic, May 2024)
The materials allowed to be exposed in the system are limited to Silicon, SiO2, Si3N4, SiOXNY, and polymer films such as photoresist, PMMA, and polyimide. Other materials can be placed in the chamber with staff approval. 
Helium back-side cooling is used to keep the sample cool during the etch. Temperature control is very important as the polymer passivation layer is chemically etched away by the fluorine gas at elevated temperatures, resulting in loss of profile control. For pieces mounted to carriers, it might be important to use an adhesive for uniform temperature - contact supervisor for options. 
The etch rate is dependent on the open area of silicon (macro-loading effect) with large open area samples etching slower than small open area samples. Features with a high aspect ratio will also etch slower than more open areas. This is known as RIE lag or the micro-loading effect. 
The in-situ laser monitor installed on this system allows for repeatable etches and endpoint detection via continuous optical monitoring of the wafer reflectivity in a user-determined location, through a porthole on the chamber.

### Preventing Wafer Breakage
It is very important that your wafer does not stick to the top-side clamp in the chamber. The clamp will get hot during long etches, causing thick photoresists to soften and adhere to the clamp, resulting if wafer loss and breakage. 
**Users must remove photoresist from the wafer edge** to prevent this. We have photolithographic methods for performing this cleanly, or simple swabbing with EBR100 also works well. 
See this page for Edge-Bead Removal techniques: [**Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photolithography_-_Manual_Edge-Bead_Removal_Techniques ""Photolithography - Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques"")
**Remove at least 7mm around ALL of the outer edge of the 4-inch wafer. Do not try to save die by removing less, or you will lose the whole wafer and require the chamber to be vented.**
Pieces of wafers can be placed onto 4"" silicon wafers, or mounted as long as material does not get on the clamp. It is common for through-silicon etches to use a carrier wafer, often bonded with wax on the [Logitech bonder](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wafer_Bonder_\(Logitech_WBS7\) ""Wafer Bonder \(Logitech WBS7\)""), and excess wax carefully removed to ensure not adhesion to the clamp.

##  About
The Nanonex NX2000 is a nanoimprinting system that allows for direct pattern transfer from a pre-fabricated master mold into an underlying polymer material. Lateral feature sizes down to less than 10 nm have been demonstrated on this tool. The system can do thermal imprinting into a polymer at temperatures up to 200°C and chamber pressures up to 600 psi. The system can also imprint into and cure UV-cureable materials on top of underlayer polymers in order to planarize samples and provide for high aspect ratio imprint lithography. Since the system uses no rigid plates, but air pressure only, the pressure uniformity is excellent in the system. The heating and cooling rates are as high as 300°C/min. Several types of resists are supplied, including [NXR-1020](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/3/3f/NXR-1020-Datasheet.pdf ""NXR-1020-Datasheet.pdf""), [mr-l-7020](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/9/9d/Mr-l-7000-Imprint-Polymer.pdf ""Mr-l-7000-Imprint-Polymer.pdf""), and [MR-UVCur21](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/f/f9/Mr-UVCur21.pdf ""Mr-UVCur21.pdf""). The system is capable of handling piece parts up to 100 mm wafers. An additional alignment system is also available for 100 mm wafers for aligned imprinting. Non-stick coatings for master molds are deposited using FDTS in the [Molecular Vapor Deposition](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Molecular_Vapor_Deposition ""Molecular Vapor Deposition"") system. For creation of master molds, please call for a discussion of our other capabilities, including electron-beam lithography.

## About
This unit consists of a collimated deep ultraviolet (DUV) light source (mercury gas discharge short arc lamp) and power supply. The substrate is placed on a rotating chuck (not presently working) and is exposed by opening a timer-controlled shutter. 
Materials that are exposed are primarily spun-on thin films such as PMMA, PMGI, etc. 
## Detailed Specifications
  * DUV wavelengths are 200-260 nm; the lamp power is limited to 1000 Watts and can operate in either constant intensity or constant power mode
  * The full spectrum of Hg emission wavelengths from 200-450 nm is present on the sample
  * Exposure can be performed on a 4"" wafer
  * Lamps are nominally rated for 400 hours
  * A reset timer was added in Feb. 1995 to limit ""on"" time (ie. provide for auto shut-off) for bulb life conservation

## Standard Cleaning Procedure (PECVD #1)
The cleaning procedure is very important in order to have consistent result on this tool and also to keep particulate count low. After each deposition you should clean the tool following instructions carefully. The clean is done in two steps: 
  1. Wet cleaning (start cleaning by using a cleanroom wipe sprayed with DI. Wipe chamber sidewalls with it. Finish cleaning by using the cleanroom wipe sprayed with IPA. )
  2. Load the recipe for cleaning ""CF4/O2 Clean"" (edit the recipe and change ONLY time of cleaning). Follow instructions regarding a required time for cleaning.

## Standard Cleaning Procedure (PECVD #2)
The cleaning procedure is very important in order to have consistent result on this tool and also to keep particulate count low. After each deposition you should clean the tool following instructions carefully. The clean is done in two steps: 
  1. (If >29min dep time) Wet cleaning: Start cleaning by using a cleanroom wipe sprayed with DI. Wipe upper chamber sidewalls with it. Finish cleaning by using the cleanroom wipe sprayed with IPA & wiping again.
  2. Load the recipe for cleaning ""STD CF4/O2 Clean"" (edit the recipe and change ONLY time of cleaning). Follow instructions regarding required time for cleaning.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

Photolithography Recipes for the [Heidelberg MLA150](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Maskless_Aligner_\(Heidelberg_MLA150\) ""Maskless Aligner \(Heidelberg MLA150\)""). All recipes were characterized on blank Silicon wafers. For different substrate coatings/materials, you will likely need to run a focus-exposure matrix (""series"" exposure mode), using our params as a starting point. 
These recipes use the same spin and bake params as our contact aligner and stepper recipes, using built-in hotplates on the photoresist spinner benches. 
_**Any I-Line PR is usable**_ , although we only characterized a select few below. Run your own Focus-Exposure Matrix to characterize a new PR. 
**_Note:_** On this tool, it is common to have to run a Focus-Exposure Matrix (aka. FEM), via ""_Series_ "" exposure mode, for each new layer structure and/or critical feature size. The layer structure can strongly affect the exposure parameters. See the [FEM Analysis Tips page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ASML_Stepper_3_Standard_Operating_Procedure#Tips_for_FEM_analysis ""ASML Stepper 3 Standard Operating Procedure"") for how to choose the proper exposure parameters. 
The [**MLA** **Troubleshooting > Out-of-Focus Exposures**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Out_Of_Focus_Exposures ""MLA150 - Troubleshooting"") section can help you avoid bad exposures, please read it! 
### Positive Resist (MLA150)
_We found that positive PR's worked well with the 405nm laser - the 375nm laser would likely also work. Sub-micron features are possible. Overexposure is recommended to avoid stitching and horiz/vert discrepancies; compensate for widening/narrowing using CD Bias[as described here](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Design_Guidelines#High-Resolution_Writing ""MLA150 - Design Guidelines"")._
Note: calibrations done with the ""HIMT design"" will show higher dose, due to using only dark-field line/space patterns.

| Notes on SPR 220-7 Greyscale: Rehydration after exposure is necessary, to prevent bubbles at PEB. Stitching leaves ridges in Y-direction with ~5% height of removed PR depth. Can be reduced via reflow, but significantly affects PR profile.  Author Credit: Patrick Curtis, 2022 & Biljana Stamenic 2023 & Demis D. John 2023; Please see our [publications policy](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Publications_acknowledging_the_Nanofab ""Frequently Asked Questions"").  
*_Rehydration_ : After exposure, leave sample in lab air (ok to cover in tray, with tinfoil). Allows water vapor in air to diffuse into PR to complete chemical reaction. **_PEB: Post-exposure bake_ : after exposure, before develop  ***_Reflow_ : To smooth out stitching lines.

### Electron Beam Resists Available
EBL Resists are custom-mixed according to user resolution needs - contact [Bill Mitchell](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Bill_Mitchell ""Bill Mitchell"") to get a bottle. 
Currently available at UCSB are: 
  * **PMMA** : (950K in anisole, 950K in MIBK, 495K in anisole, 50K in anisole) 
    * High-resolution positive polymer-based resist with relatively poor sensitivity (resolution scales directly and sensitivity scales inversely with molecular weight);
    * Poor plasma etch resistance, hence used primarily to fabricate metal lines via liftoff processes (via a bi-layer resist scheme...low MW on bottom, high MW on top for single lines, or vice-versa for T-gate fabrication);
    * Utilizes an inert solvent developer (usually MIBK:IPA mixtures)


  * **P(MMA-MAA) copolymer** : (low MW methyl-methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) copolymers in ethyl lactate) 
    * A positive polymer-based resist with poor resolution but with significantly higher sensitivity than the higher MW PMMA resists above
    * Used primarily as the top layer in a bi-layer resist scheme for T-Gate fabrication, and utilizes inert solvent developer (MIBK:IPA mixtures)


  * **CSAR-62** : ZEP-equivalent resist manufactured in Germany at much more competitive pricing! 
    * High-resolution polymer-based positive resist with very good sensitivity and excellent etch resistance
    * Can be used in both metal lift-off processes (slight overexposure results in an excellent undercut profile) and various dry-etch processes for pattern transfer to the underlying substrate
    * Utilizes inert solvent developers (e.g., n-amyl acetate for higher sensitivity and good resolution or MIBK:IPA mixtures for increased LER performance)


  * **maN-2403** : negative polymer-based resist (that is NOT chemically amplified) 
    * Very good resolution (down to the 40-50nm range) and sensitivity
    * Exhibits excellent dry-etch resistance
    * Developed using a dilute basic solution (e.g., metal-ion-free developers such as AZ-300MIF)


  * **HSQ** : negative resist that is based on spin-on glass material (ie, not polymer-based) 
    * Extremely good resolution (features below 10nm can be resolved)
    * Etch resistance is high in Cl-based chemistries since HSQ reduces to a porous SiOx structure after exposure and development
    * Sensitivity and contrast are very dependent on developer solution used and are usually poor 
      * Standard AZ300MIF developer solutions have decent sensitivity (100's of uC/cm2 at 100kV) but extremely poor contrast
      * Stronger (and toxic!) 25%TMAH solutions have much better contrast but poor sensitivity (1000's of uC/cm2 at 100kV)
      * ""Salty"" developer solutions using 1wt% NaCl dissolved in either 4wt% NaOH or AZ300MIF solutions have the best contrast but reduce sensitivity significantly (10,000's of uC/cm2 at 100kV)


  * **DUV resists: UV6, UV210 UVN-30** : chemically amplified polymer-based resists 
    * High resolution and excellent sensitivity (clearing doses below 100uC/cm2 at 100kV)
    * UV6 used mostly in optimized t-gate resist structures
    * Developed using a dilute basic solution (e.g., metal-ion-free developers such as AZ-300MIF)
    * Can be ""double exposed"" by [ASML DUV Stepper](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML_DUV\) ""Stepper 3 \(ASML DUV\)"") and EBL. 
      * Recommended to produce ASML alignment marks first for double exposure methods.
    * See ASML litho recipes for datasheets.


### EBL Exposure Recipes
_**To Be Added**_ - BEAMER simulation is always required for small (<<micron) features.

# About
The Sharon is a cryo-pumped thin film evaporator with a Telemark 8 pocket electron beam evaporation source. Fixturing in EBeam1 will accept any size sample up to 4-inch diameter. In addition, a rotation fixture is easily installed which permits adjustable angle, 360° rotation of any size sample, up to 4-inch diameter. This feature is particularly useful for promoting step coverage of irregular surfaces. 
EBeam1 is used for the evaporation of high purity metals, e.a. Al, Au, Ni, Ge, AuGe, Ti, Pt etc., for interconnect and ohmic contact metallization for fabrication of III-V compound semiconductor and silicon device fabrication.

This fixture **works well for[Lift-off](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lithography_Recipes#Lift-Off_Recipes ""Lithography Recipes"")**, because the angles on the fixture is designed to be perpendicular to the point-source deposition source. Staff routinely uses this holder for Lift-off. 
### Procedure
  1. Mount your wafers to the 4-wafer fixture while it is NOT installed in the tool. Like so - setup the fixture on the table:[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/1e/EB-1_4-wf_fixture_01_empty.png/300px-EB-1_4-wf_fixture_01_empty.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:EB-1_4-wf_fixture_01_empty.png)
  2. Insert a ~1-inch long 1/4-20 Bolt from the underside, with a 1/4-20 Nut on the top side, like so:[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/fc/EB-1_4-wf_fixture_02_bolt.png/300px-EB-1_4-wf_fixture_02_bolt.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:EB-1_4-wf_fixture_02_bolt.png)
  3. Insert your wafers **Face-Down** and secure them with the CuBe Clips:[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/1c/EB-1_4-wf_fixture_03_wafers_inserted.jpg/300px-EB-1_4-wf_fixture_03_wafers_inserted.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:EB-1_4-wf_fixture_03_wafers_inserted.jpg)CORRECTION - 1/4-20 bolt + nut may be inserted in center already.
  4. Load into tool, securing at the top with the single 1/4-20 bolt + nut, and Ensuring the Crystal Monitor does not shadow any wafers, as pictured here:[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/5a/EB-1_4-wf_fixture_04_fixture_loaded_in_chamber.jpg/300px-EB-1_4-wf_fixture_04_fixture_loaded_in_chamber.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:EB-1_4-wf_fixture_04_fixture_loaded_in_chamber.jpg)

## About
This electron-beam evaporation system is used for the controlled deposition of thin dielectric films. The films are evaporated from a wide variety of solid sources. The most common dielectrics deposited are: SiO2, ITO, TiO2, Ta2O5, and SrF2. Other materials may be evaporated upon request. Oxygen gas can be bled into the system during deposition to try to maintain the stoichiometry during deposition. Fixturing for heating the substrate can also be used. A crystal thickness monitor is used to control the deposition thickness. The dielectrics deposited by this system are typically used for optical coatings (anti-reflective), electrical insulators, and reactive ion etching masks. Samples up to ~ 5"" diameter can be placed into this system for evaporation. Typical deposition rates are several Angstroms/second.

# About
This electron-beam evaporation system is the work-horse of the lab for metal deposition. The system has the unique feature of a home-built load-lock system that allows very quick cycle time for evaporation (as low as 20 minutes total time). The system also has two 4-pocket e-beam sources and an Inficon IC/5 deposition controller that allows for co-deposition of certain metals. The front gun contains metals Ti, Pt, Ni, Au and the back gun contains metals Pd, Al, Ag, Ge. These metals stay under high vacuum at all times, except during maintenance, to maintain source purity. One wafer up to 4” diameter or multiple pieces can be placed into this system for evaporation. There is also a special fixture that can be inserted for angling the sample during deposition. This system is used for n-type ohmic contact metalization to compound semiconductors, Schottky contacts to semiconductors, bond pads, and other general metalizations. The maximum deposition thickness during a run is limited to 1 micron.

## About
This electron-beam evaporation system is a bell-jar type system and has the capability to do up to 9-4” wafers in a lift-off configuration and up to 18-4” wafers in a sidewall coverage configuration. Rotational motion in combination with baffling is used for lift-off and provides roughly 5% uniformity across a 4” wafer. The sidewall coverage fixturing uses full planetary motion to provide coverage over all sidewalls. The system also an 8-pocket e-beam source and an Inficon IC/5 deposition controller that allows for programming of fully automated multiple layer depositions.

## About
This electron-beam evaporation system is a bell-jar type system and has the capability to do up to 9-4” wafers in a lift-off configuration and up to 18-4” wafers in a sidewall coverage configuration. Rotational motion in combination with baffling is used for lift-off and provides roughly 5% uniformity across a 4” wafer. The sidewall coverage fixturing uses full planetary motion to provide coverage over all sidewalls. The system also an 8-pocket e-beam source and an Inficon IC/5 deposition controller that allows for programming of fully automated multiple layer depositions. The metals available for deposition are Al, Ti, Au, Pt, Ni, Pd, Ag, Ge, Fe, NiCr, NiFe and Cr. This system is used for n-type ohmic contact metalization to compound semiconductors, Schottky contacts to semiconductors, bond pads, and other general metalizations. The maximum deposition thickness during a run is limited to 1.0 microns.

# About
The 6300FS machine was installed at UCSB in May 2007. 
This system uses the vector scan approach for electron beam deflection within a field, step and repeat for stage movement between fields, the combination of which allows the entire area of the sample to be exposed to the electron beam. 
The machine can be run at 25, 50 and 100 kV. Note however that only the 100kV mode is used at UCSB. 
# Applications
  * Quantum devices in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures
  * Photonic crystal production for various photonic band-gap applications
  * sub-50nm gates for T-Gate production in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures

# Electron Beam Resists
Currently available at UCSB are: 
  * **PMMA** : (950K in anisole, 950K in MIBK, 495K in anisole, 50K in anisole): very high-resolution positive polymer-based resist with relatively poor sensitivity (resolution scales directly and sensitivity scales inversely with molecular weight); very poor plasma etch resistance, hence used primarily to fabricate metal lines via liftoff processes (via a bi-layer resist scheme...low MW on bottom, high MW on top for single lines, or vice-versa for T-gate fabrication); utilizes an inert solvent developer (usually MIBK:IPA mixtures)


  * **P(MMA-MAA) copolymer** : (low MW methyl-methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) copolymers in ethyl lactate): a positive polymer-based resist with poor resolution but with significantly higher sensitivity than the higher MW PMMA resists above; used primarily as the top layer in a bi-layer resist scheme for T-Gate fabrication, and utilizes inert solvent developer (MIBK:IPA mixtures)


  * **CSAR-62** : ZEP-equivalent resist manufactured in Germany at much more competitive pricing!; very high-resolution polymer-based positive resist with very good sensitivity and excellent etch resistance; can be used in both metal lift-off processes (slight overexposure results in an excellent undercut profile) and various dry-etch processes for pattern transfer to the underlying substrate; utilizes inert solvent developers (e.g., n-amyl acetate for higher sensitivity and good resolution or MIBK:IPA mixtures for increased LER performance)


  * **maN-2403** : negative polymer-based resist (that is NOT chemically amplified) with very good resolution (down to the 40-50nm range) and sensitivity; exhibits excellent dry-etch resistance; developed using a dilute basic solution (e.g., metal-ion-free developers such as AZ-300MIF)


  * **HSQ** : negative resist that is based on spin-on glass material (ie, not polymer-based) with extremely good resolution (features below 10nm can be resolved); etch resistance is high in Cl-based chemistries since HSQ reduces to a porous SiOx structure after exposure and development; sensitivity and contrast are very dependent on developer solution used and are usually poor - standard AZ300MIF developer solutions have decent sensitivity (100's of uC/cm2 at 100kV) but extremely poor contrast, stronger (and toxic!) 25%TMAH solutions have much better contrast but poor sensitivity (1000's of uC/cm2 at 100kV), ""salty"" developer solutions using 1wt% NaCl dissolved in either 4wt% NaOH or AZ300MIF solutions have the best contrast but reduce sensitivity significantly (10,000's of uC/cm2 at 100kV)


  * **UV6/UVN-210** : chemically amplified polymer-based resists with high resolution and excellent sensitivity (clearing doses below 100uC/cm2 at 100kV); UV6 used mostly in optimized t-gate resist structures; developed using a dilute basic solution (e.g., metal-ion-free developers such as AZ-300MIF)

Edge Bead Removal via Photolithography for 4-inch Wafers,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Edge_Bead_Removal_via_Photolithography_for_4-inch_Wafers,"This method significantly lowers the risk of breaking a wafer in clamped systems such as the DSEiii or Fluorine Etcher. 
This process only removes the outermost photoresist for Positive PR's. For Negative PR's, your should design you litho so there is no exposure on the outer 7mm, so the PR is removed during develop. 
The metal edge-bead removal masks are in the Suss MA-6 Contact Aligner drawers, and I recommend the ""4mm recessed"".

### I-Line Photo-EBR Process
  * Spin/cure an I-Line photoresist using your standard photolith. params (for example [SPR 220-3](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_\(GCA_6300\) ""Stepper Recipes"")).
  * Don't load a mask plate.
  * Turn off ""Load Mask"" mode - you will likely need to confirm that no mask is present.
  * Place the wafer on the [MA-6 Contact Aligner](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Aligner_\(SUSS_MA-6\) ""Contact Aligner \(SUSS MA-6\)"") with the metal mask in place. 
  * You will use [Lamp Test] for the exposure. You can also use ""Flood Expose"" program and type in an exposure time.
  * Expose for about 3-2x longer than your normal exposure time.
  * Load wafer into your I-Line exposure tool & Expose your process
  * Run your PEB and Develop as per your normal process. 
    * (If you did not develop the EBR yet, it should go away in this step.)


### DUV Photo-EBR Process
  * Spin/cure a DUV photoresist using your standard photolith. params (for example [UV6](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28ASML_DUV.29 ""Stepper Recipes"")).
  * Place the wafer on the [**DUV Flood Exposer**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/DUV_Flood_Expose ""DUV Flood Expose"") with the metal mask in place. 
  * Turn on rotation on slow (so mask doesn't move), lamp warmup is not required.
  * Expose for 13 sec, with slow rotation.
  * _Optionally:_ PEB 135°C, 60sec, Develop, dry (in SRD), then proceed. This did not affect my primary lithography when I did this step separately. I've also done photo-EBR where I combined this EBR exposure with the primary Imaging litho. and only did a single develop.
  * Load wafer into ASML & Expose your process
  * PEB 135°C, 90sec
  * 300MiF develop as per your normal process. 
    * (If you did not develop the EBR yet, it should go away in this step.)

## Basic Editing
### Editing an Existing Page
The First step is to log in: 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/e/e1/Wiki-_Log_In_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_4.14.49_PM.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Wiki-_Log_In_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_4.14.49_PM.png)
All active NanoFab users can make a login - see [this FAQ](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_get_a_login_to_the_wiki.3F ""Frequently Asked Questions"") for how to do that. 
Then navigate to the page you want to edit. 
Once you are at the page, click on ""_**Edit**_ "" to launch the _Edit Source_ "", allows you to edit the **not recommended**. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/7/7a/Basic1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Basic1.png)Click Edit.
After clicking _[Edit]_ , you will be able to type directly into the page to make your changes. 
There are a couple of key things to note on this page. 
Press the **[ < Back]** button on your web browser to cancel/discard any changes you made.  
**Save page** : Clicking this will save any and all changes you have made.  
**Show preview** : This will show you a preview of what the page will look like after you save it.  
**Show changes** : This will give you a before and after comparison of the page.  
**Cancel** : This will cancel any changes.  

  * The Visual Editor opened by hitting _[Edit]_ is pretty self-explanatory for most purposes. See the 
  * Please use **Show Preview** to make sure your edits look as expected.
  * Be sure to enter a brief _description of what you changed_ , so Editors can approve you changes quickly.


The two editing methods: 
Using the Visual Editor on a text page, via the **[Edit]** tab (recommended): 
[![Visual Editor in action, animated](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/39/VisualEditor_In_Action_v1.gif/650px-VisualEditor_In_Action_v1.gif)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:VisualEditor_In_Action_v1.gif)
(_Not recommended_) The _**[Edit Source]**_ mode, showing wikimarkup source code for the page. _[Rich Editor]_ provides some code shortcuts: 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/da/Basic2.png/650px-Basic2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Basic2.png)
We do have some old antiquated ""coded"" parts of the site, which are holdovers from before we installed the modern ""Visual Editor"". Due to existing page linking/URLs, many of these can't be changed (such as code used for superscripts and subscripts in page names). 
### Making a New Page
Only Staff & Admins can make new pages. If you want to do this but don’t have permission, please let the [wiki admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") know and we’ll be happy to help you complete your edits. 
The preferred way to make a new page is to first create a Link to a page that doesn't exist (within an existing page), and then follow that Link to create the new page. Do this as follows: 
  1. On the existing page, [Edit] the page, and type the text you would like to become a hyperlink.
  2. Select the desired text, and click the Hyperlink button [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8c/Editing_Toolbar_Hyperlink_Button_01.png/24px-Editing_Toolbar_Hyperlink_Button_01.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Toolbar_Hyperlink_Button_01.png) which pops up the link panel.
  3. Type the _**desired name of the new page**_ into the ""search"" field - it will show a red link in the search field, indicating that the page doesn't exist yet. [![Screenshot of hyperlink panel, Creating a hyperlink to a nonexisting page.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/da/Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_01.png/300px-Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_01.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_01.png)Creating a hyperlink to a nonexisting page.
  4. Click the Red Link in the menu, which then sets this as the target of your Hyperlink.[![Screenshot showing Hyperlink panel to nonexisting page - Showing Arrow to CLICK on RedLink](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/94/Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_02_-_CLICK_arrow.png.png/300px-Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_02_-_CLICK_arrow.png.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_02_-_CLICK_arrow.png.png)Click on the RedLink in the search results.
  5. Save the changes you have made to this page.
  6. After Saving the page, you will see a ""Red Link"" - _**colored red because it leads to a nonexistent page.**_ [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/b1/RedLink_Screenshot.png/189px-RedLink_Screenshot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:RedLink_Screenshot.png)A ""red link"", linking to a nonexistent page.
  7. Click the red-link to the nonexistent page, which will show an option to create the new page.
  8. Click [Create] to make the new page in VisualEditor mode (defaults to Source mode, which is not recommended). [![Screenshot showing to Click on ""Create"" Tab to enter VisualEditing Mode](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/bc/Click_on_%22Create%22_Tab_to_enter_VisualEditing_Mode.png/506px-Click_on_%22Create%22_Tab_to_enter_VisualEditing_Mode.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Click_on_%22Create%22_Tab_to_enter_VisualEditing_Mode.png)Click on the ""Create"" Tab to enter VisualEditing Mode
  9. Make sure to ""Save"" the new page!


### Inserting images into a page
Only Staff & Admins May upload files. If you want to do this but don’t have permission, please let the [wiki admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") know and we’ll be happy to help you complete your edits. 
There are numerous ways to insert an image into a page you are editing. Here we describe one method only that is the easiest to follow. 
In addition, there are various options that allow you to insert the image inline with text, or on it's own line with a caption+border, or off to the side with text flowing around it. These are each described at the bottom. 
  1. You should be in VisualEditor mode on the page, not source mode. Click the **|Create|** tab to enter VisualEditor mode.
  2. Place your text cursor in the location you would like to insert the image.
  3. In the VisualEditor toolbar, click _**Insert > Media**_. You can insert your image in two ways 
    1. If the image is already uploaded to the server, use the ""__Search__ "" tab to find it and select it.
    2. If you would like to upload a new image from your computer, switch to the ""__Upload__ "" tab > (Choose File) to select the file on your computer, and upload it. Please give it a filename that begins with the purpose of the image, eg. ""_LEXT Instructions - Cancel button.jpg_ "" or ""_E-Beam1 Tool Photograph.png_ "". This makes it easy to search for your image, and know what it is used for (and it won't get accidentally deleted this way!).
  4. Click ""_**Use This Image**_ "". The Image's ""**Media Settings** "" window will automatically pop up. The ""**General Settings** "" fields are optional.
  5. Switch to the ""**Advanced Settings** "" panel 
    1. If you want to have the image ""float"" to any convenient place on the page, leave **[√] Wrap text around this item** enabled. See the ""Floating image"" example to the right → [![floating happy mac image](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/8/8b/MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)""Floating"" Image example
      1. To include a caption, use the **Thumbnail** image type, and set the caption in the **General Settings** pane.
    2. If you want the image to show up in-line with your text, like this: [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8b/MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png/20px-MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)
      1. Uncheck **[√]_Wrap text around this item_**
      2. Choose ""frameless"" or ""basic"" image type
    3. Optionally click _**Image Size > Custom**_ and reduce _only_ _one_ of the sizes until the image size looks good. 
      1. Image Widths (1st field) of about 200-600px look good as stand-alone images, floating on the page.
      2. Image Heights (2nd field) of about 10-40px look good inline next to text.

First you upload the PDF (or other acceptable file type), and copy the link to the newly uploaded PDF, and then paste that link into your Wiki page. It is useful to do this with two separate windows open, one for editing the wiki page you want to add a link on, and another for uploading the file. 
  1. Make sure you are logged in. If you get logged out during this process, don't close any windows, [instead follow this](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#.22Something_went_wrong.22_while_saving_my_edits.21_How_do_I_keep_my_edits.3F).
  2. Optionally, _**open a new web-browser window**_ for performing the file upload.
  3. In the left sidebar, near the bottom, click **Upload FIle**     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/0/09/Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_1-_upload_file.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_1-_upload_file.png)
  4. Click **[Choose File]** and select the file from your computer you want to upload.     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/02/Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_2-_choose_file.png/238px-Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_2-_choose_file.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_2-_choose_file.png)
  5. **Enter the filename** you'd like the file to have once it is on the server. Something simple like ""ToolName - SOP.pdf"" etc. Make sure you keep the same file extension. Also Enter a **Description** of the file, can be as simple as the above. This makes it searchable on the wiki.      [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/85/Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_3b-_filename_descript_upload_button.png/300px-Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_3b-_filename_descript_upload_button.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_3b-_filename_descript_upload_button.png)   

  6. Click the **[Upload]** button, and wait for the upload to complete (after which a new page will show). 
    1. If it shows a warning, choose **[Submit modified filename/description]**         [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/f4/Editing_Tutorials_3c-_modifications_etc..png/500px-Editing_Tutorials_3c-_modifications_etc..png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_3c-_modifications_etc..png)
  7. On the resulting _File Info_ page, right-click the file link and **Copy Link/URL**.     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/5a/Editing_Tutorials_4b-_file_info_right_click_URL.png/380px-Editing_Tutorials_4b-_file_info_right_click_URL.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_4b-_file_info_right_click_URL.png)
  8. Back on the wiki page you're editing, select the text you want to link, and paste in the URL as an _External Link_.     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Editing_Tutorials_-_5-_insert_link_into_page.png/400px-Editing_Tutorials_-_5-_insert_link_into_page.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_5-_insert_link_into_page.png)


#### Linking to a file you already uploaded
If you already uploaded the file and now need to link to it, you can find the uploaded file and copy the link as follows: 
  1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom section ""**Tools** "", click ""**Upload File** "".
  2. On that page, click the link for ""**List of Uploaded Files** "" in the 2nd sentence.
  3. Locate your file in the list.
  4. Click the Title of the file, which brings you to the File's _File Info_ page - same as the above procedure (Step 7).     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/4b/Editing_Tutorials_-_List_of_Uploaded_Files_-_click_the_file_title_to_get_file_page.png/625px-Editing_Tutorials_-_List_of_Uploaded_Files_-_click_the_file_title_to_get_file_page.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_List_of_Uploaded_Files_-_click_the_file_title_to_get_file_page.png)
  5. From here, follow Step 7 above onwards - you can now copy the directly link to the file itself, and insert into your desired Wiki page, as described above.


### Updating an uploaded file to a new version
You can replace an uploaded file with a new version. This means any links will now point to the new version. 
  * Find the ""File:"" page for the existing file on the wiki. Do this by: 
    * Searching the Wiki for the _file name_ of the original file, or part of the file name. **Hit [Enter] in the search bar** to show all search results.
    * In the search results, click on the Wiki-Page of your File - it will begin with ""**File:** "", such as ""File: My Photo.jpg""
    * Under ""File History"", click ""**upload new version** "".
    * Upload your new version of the file. It will automatically have exact same destination file name on the server, so all links to the file will still work.
    * (It can take ~1 day for user's web browsers to stop using cached old versions of the file.)


## Administration
### Approving Edits (Staff/Admin only)
While lab users are allowed to modify the wiki, their edits will not become visible to anyone until a staff member approves those edits. (When any member of the staff edits a page, those edits are automatically approved.) 
**NOTE TO** **STAFF:** **Take care to watch for approvals before editing** because if a page has edits waiting to be approved and you edit the page normally, those edits will automatically be approved!! Before you edit a page, always make sure that there are no new revisions waiting to be approved (this is described below). 
When you arrive at a page, you will see one of two messages. Either **""No new revisions""** or **""THERE ARE NEW REVISIONS TO THIS PAGE.""**. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/5/5f/Approve1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve1.png)No new revisions. |  [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/c7/Approve2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve2.png)THERE ARE NEW REVISIONS TO THIS PAGE.  
---|---  
If there are new revisions, click on the **history** tab. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/5/52/Approve3.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve3.png)History tab.
This will take you to the full edit history of the page. You will see an entry that has a star on it, this is the current approved revision. Anything after that (above it) has not yet been approved. Put the LEFT radial button on the currently approved revision and set the right radial button anywhere above it to compare other additions. Click ""**Compare selected revisions** "". 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/2d/Approve4.png/1000px-Approve4.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve4.png)History
The window will show you the before (on the left) and the after (on the right). You can also scroll down to see how the NEW page actually looks (AFTER the edit you are view has taken effect). In this case, the user ""Guest"" has deleted the sentence ""The Sharon is a cryo-pumped thin film evaporator with a Temescal four hearth 270° bent beam evaporation source."" and has inserted the sentence ""THIS IS A TEST"". If you like the edit and want to keep it, go back (by pressing the back button in your web-browser) and then click approve next to the edit in question. If you do NOT like the edit, click ""**undo** "", then scroll to the bottom of the page that opens and click save. If you like part of the edit but want to modify it, approve it, then edit the page as you normally would. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/8/8d/Approve5.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve5.png)
### My Watchlist
Your watchlist is the set of pages that you are ""watching"" for changes. You can view you watchlist at any time by clicking the link in the top right of the screen. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/a/a1/Watch1.png/400px-Watch1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Watch1.png)
I strongly recommend that you each add your tools to your watch list. This will allow you to see whenever these pages are modified by a user. To add a page to your watch list, go to the page you want to add and click on ""**watch** "" at the top of the page. (To remove a page from you watchlist, do the same thing, the button will read ""**unwatch** "" instead.) 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/12/Watch2.png/400px-Watch2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Watch2.png)
You can also set it up so that you will recieve an e-mail any time one of the pages on your watchlist is changed (by someone other then yourself). I would also HIGHLY recommend doing this. These emails will come from NanofabWiki@ece.ucsb.edu so you can setup a filter and put all these e-mails in one folder. You will only receive one e-mail per page between visits. In other words if 10 people make changes back to back. You will only get ONE e-mail notifying you that a change has been made, not 10 e-mails. As soon as you view the page form your account, that resets so any changes made after you view it will result in another, single e-mail. 
To set this up go to your preferences by click on the ""**my preferences** "". 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/44/Watch3.png/400px-Watch3.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Watch3.png)
In your preferences you will find a lot of options. The 2 that you need to take care of are your e-mail address (enter it into the box labeled ""E-mail"") and you need to check the box next to ""E-mail me when a page on my watch-list is changed."" Save the changed by clicking ""Save"" at the bottom of the page. 
### Editing Restrictions
To prevent unauthorized editing on the site, we have setup 4 different user groups. These restrictions only pertain to EDITING. 
1) **Annonymous/Unregistered users**     Anyone not registered or not logged in will not be able to edit anything on the site.
2) **Lab Users**     This is anyone who we know to be doing research in the lab (names taken from SignupMonkey). They are allowed to edit existing pages but are not allowed to upload files or create new pages. All edits by _Lab Users_ have to be approved by staff members before they are viewable on the site.
3) **Staff**     This group consist of all staff members. Staff will be able to edit 95% of the pages on the wiki. There are a select few pages on the site that are locked. For example, on the [Main Page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Main_Page ""Main Page""), _Staff_ do not have the option to ""EDIT"" the page, only the option to ""VIEW SOURCE""
4) **Administrators**     This group is for the people in charge of maintaining the nitty-gritty of the site. They have unrestricted access and can change anything on the site. They can also change the ""user group level"" for any user.
## Troubleshooting / FAQ
### It won't let me ""Save"" my changes!
Sometimes the web server logs you out due to ""inactivity"" when you are actually just spending a long time editing a page. Thus, when you try to ""_**save page**_ "", you get an error like ""you are not authorized to edit this page"" since it thinks you're not logged in. 
This is the typical error: 
```
We could not save your edit because the session was no longer valid. Do you want to save this page as an anonymous user instead? Your IP address will be recorded in this page's edit history.

```

If this happens, do Not close the window with your unsaved edits! 
A quick workaround is to open a New web-browser window, navigate to the [wiki](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Main_Page ""Main Page"") and [log in there](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Special:UserLogin ""Special:UserLogin""). After a few seconds, try saving the edited page again, and it should work this time. You may have to hit ""_**Try Again**_ "" for it to work. 
If this does not work, you want to be sure you don't lose all your hard work! One way to do this is to copy the Wiki Code into a text file on your computer, as follows: If you are using the VisualEditor (default), switch to Source Code view via the _**Pen button**_ [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/b5/Visual_Editor_-_switch_to_source_mode_-_pen_button.png/38px-Visual_Editor_-_switch_to_source_mode_-_pen_button.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Visual_Editor_-_switch_to_source_mode_-_pen_button.png) > _**[Source Editing]**_ , then _**Select All**_ and _**Copy**_ the code for the page. Then paste it into a NotePad.exe or TextEdit.app window on your computer (optionally save the file to your computer somewhere). 
Then, once you have managed to log back into the Wiki, you can edit the '_**Source**_ ' of the page and _**paste**_ your source code in the appropriate place. Be sure to ""Preview"" the results to make sure it worked as expected, and that you pasted into the right spot! 
### I can't upload my file - it says the file is too large
For uploaded files, there is a maximum file size limit and a limited list of allowed file types, to prevent hacking and viruses. If you run into one of these limitations please contact the [Wiki Admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") and they can help you get the file uploaded and properly linked.

## About
The Woolam M-2000DI Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometer is used for the general characterization of optical thin films using ellipsometry. 
This tool incorporates a wavelength range from 193nm up to 1650nm and a motorized variable angle control from 45 degrees to 90 degrees in order to provide the widest flexibility for characterization of optical (and some electrical) properties of thin films. The CompletEASE software makes measurement taking and simple analysis very straightforward and provides for complex multi-layer and absorbing film analysis as well. All data is saved for each film so that post-measurement analysis can be performed. This system is also in-situ capable for the ALD system in the facility. 
## Specifications
  * Film Thickness Range: about 0.5nm to ~10-15µm. (Both of these extremes are difficult but can be measured with some effort.)
  * Sample Size: ≥7mm unpatterned thin-film area. Larger wafers possible with limited range of motion.
  * Refractive Index (n) / Absorption (k)
  * Wavelength range: 193–1650nm (Deuterium + Quartz-Tungsten Halogen Lamps)
  * Angles: 45° – 90°
  * Models for many materials available, including general-purpose models such as: 
    * Cauchy (n) with Urbach absorption (k),
    * Sellmeier (n),
    * B-Spline/Lorentz/Drude for absorbing/metallic films
    * General Oscillator for complex refractive index/absorption
    * Many ""Tabulated"" models, where the RIx & Absorption are fixed (not fit), so only Thickness is fit.

Ellipsometer (Woollam) - Measuring thin dielectrics with Native Oxide pre-measurement,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ellipsometer_(Woollam)_-_Measuring_thin_dielectrics_with_Native_Oxide_pre-measurement,"To measure very thin (<<30nm) transparent dielectric (ie. glass/oxide) films on a Silicon witness sample, you need to account for the Native Oxide already present on the Silicon wafer. This is because the refractive index of those films is somewhat similar to the native oxide, so the optical measurement can't distinguish it. In addition, ellipsometry can't measure refractive index for films <20nm, further compounding the problem. 
(You can optionally HF-etch the oxide prior to deposition to remove it - it typically takes hours to regrow to measurable thicknesses.) 
The method is very similar to Example B in the SOP, or the method for measuring thin metals - you just 
  * Pre-measure the native oxide on the silicon witness _before_ the primary deposition. Save the Snapshot and/or Data of this measurement.
  * Perform your deposition step.
  * Measure again, but utilize your previously measured layer as a ""frozen"" (non-fitting) layer, so you are only measuring the newly deposited film.


Detailed steps can be found in [Ellipsometer (Woollam) - Measuring thin metals with oxide pre-measurement](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ellipsometer_\(Woollam\)_-_Measuring_thin_metals_with_oxide_pre-measurement ""Ellipsometer \(Woollam\) - Measuring thin metals with oxide pre-measurement""), but instead of a ~500nm Thermal oxide pre-measurement, you are measuring the native oxide (~2nm) on the silicon substrate. Other steps for saving/re-fitting data are the same.

## General NanoFab Questions
### How do I get access to the lab?
See the [Services](https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/services) page and click on the appropriate entity (universtiy/company etc.) to see the process and paperwork needed for your staff to access our lab in-person. The [_hourly rates_](https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/services#comp-k3rx7hk4) are also listed on this page. External universities and companies are welcome to access our lab. 
#### Can staff perform fabrication for us?
Yes, for certain types of jobs. [_See this page for more info_](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Services#Fabrication_Services_by_NanoFab_Staff ""Services""). 
### Who do I contact for an equipment problem or general NanoFab problem?
For _general_ NanoFab issues (that affect the whole NanoFab), please contact the [Lab Director (click for contact info)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"") by email or phone. 
It's **much** better to quickly let us know of a mistake or problem proactively, and let us help you fix it! 
#### Emergencies
For immediate or health-related emergencies, call 9-911 from any of the phones in the lab, or 911 from your cell phone. Let them know that you are in **""Engineering Sciences Building #225""** at **""Room #1102 - Gowning Room""**. 
#### Specific Equipment Problem
Always notify maintainers _**immediately**_ of any unusual problem that may affect other tool users, and also _record it in the logbook_! 
  1. If you are having trouble with a piece of equipment, please contact the supervisor of that tool **first**. The supervisor's contact information can be found posted on the walls above/behind the equipment, on the [tool page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tool_List ""Tool List"") and on the tool's SignupMonkey page. 
    1. If you need immediate assistance _during business hours_ , you may call/text the tool supervisor's cell phone number, otherwise use their office phone or email.
    2. If the tool is down, please place a note at the tool in addition to reporting the issue.
  2. If the engineer is not available, please go to the tool's signup page on [SignupMonkey](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu) and click the ""**_Report a Tool Issue_** "" button. This emails all Nanofab Staff _and_ all users with future reservations _and_ texts the tool supervisor. This is the preferred method for getting help if the supervisor is not immediately available.
  3. If the tool is not on SignupMonkey, **email the NanoFab Staff at**. This emails all staff, so anyone available can help you.


#### Contact all NanoFab Staff by Email
The entire NanoFab staff can be emailed at 
#### NanoFab On-Call Staff
For after-hours and weekend emergency situations, please call **[** to contact the staff member that is on-call. This is for major issues/emergencies that will affect many users, such as alarms, leaks, wet bench, fume hood issues etc. Please do not call this number for problems with a single process tool that only affects a few users, instead see above. 
### After Hours Access
To enter the facility after hours, please use the **South-facing** entrance. There is a card/Symmetry reader on that exterior door. 
We DO NOT provide after hours access to the main doors on the West entrance. 
### Publications acknowledging the Nanofab
If you publish on devices or work done using the NanoFab, please add an acknowledgement or line of text stating the following (or similar):
> _A portion of this work was performed in the UCSB Nanofabrication Facility, an open access laboratory._
This is important for the continued success of the Nanofabrication Facility. This applies to local UCSB researchers as well. 
#### Authorship on Publications
If a UCSB staff scientist contributed significant research & development effort (including thinking through fabrication methods), or if you include their data/images in your paper, especially if novel work was developed, you should seriously consider **adding them as an author** (while also retaining the above Acknowledgement). Many journals require **all** contributing authors to be cited. For example, consider the _all_ contributions to the work. 
Analysis code authored by staff 
Even for repeat processes performed by our staff, it may be appropriate to include the UCSB Staff member that performed the fabrication - a number of local research groups and companies always include the person who fabricated the devices as authors. Since this is research and development, not a guaranteed off-the-shelf product, every run requires experience to produce good results for your research. 
You can specify that the staff member only performed fabrication and process development. 
Process knowledge gained from conversations, advice and brainstorming sessions may also constitute significant ""intellectual contribution"", and warrant authorship, or be worthy of an acknowledgement. 
Feel free to [contact us](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"") if you would like to discuss any of these points, and thank you for understanding. 
### What Supplies do I need to bring to the lab?
If you are traveling to use the lab, you should plan to bring your own: 
  * Optional Cleanroom Toolbelt (our new gowns have no pockets). Two options include: 
    *       * We often purchase these with 
  * Glassware for chemical processing (developer/water/solvent/acid/base). 
    * Pyrex required for heating.
    * Watch glasses/covers recommended.
    * Plastic or Teflon containers required for HF.
  * Wafers (including Silicon)
  * Mask plates for photolithography
  * Wafer storage/trays
  * Tweezers and hand-tools (scribes)
  * Wafer dippers (optional)
  * Pens/markers for labeling your items/taking notes.
  * Optional Chemical tools: magnetic stirrers, thermometers


The lab provides the following to our users at no additional charge: 
  * Storage boxes for use within the lab (not to be removed from lab without permission)
  * [Chemicals](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Chemical_List ""Chemical List"") including a selection of photoresists, developers, acids, bases and solvents.
  * Metal sources for evaporation and sputter. We don't have every metal, check with staff to see if we have the metal you need.
  * Cleanroom-compatible notebooks and paper.
  * Ziplock bags / vacuum seal bags.
  * Safety goggles - you are welcome to provide your own as long as they are ANSI Z.87 rated.
  * All gowning supplies (hoods/gown/boot covers/masks/gloves etc.)
  * Lab Consumables such as napkins, pipettes, tins, razor blades, glass slides, swabs etc.


We highly recommend to take your notes on a digital platform such as tablet/laptop that is portable for use within the lab. Small tablets with pens work very well. <135mm will fit in the gown pockets. 
### Can I take supplies from the Nanofab?
Generally **NO**! The napkins, tote boxes, bottles, flashlights, tools and all other supplies are **nanofab property!** You are NOT allowed to take any of our supplies to your lab without asking us first. Please do ask staff if there is some supply you'd like to borrow or take, we are usually happy to help. 
#### Where do I get these supplies for my lab?
For UCSB users, the [Physics](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/resources/materialsmanagement/storeroom) and [Chemistry](https://www.chem.ucsb.edu/facilities-services#storerooms) store rooms sell many common supplies we use, including tweezers, beakers/dishes etc. Otherwise you can search any standard supplier for what you need (Thermo-Fischer Scientific, Mcmaster-Carr, Entegris, Techni-Tool etc. etc.). Ask NanoFab staff if you need something quickly and we can probably help you, or tell you where to purchase the appropriate supplies. 
### Bring a new chemical/material into the lab
If you need to bring a new chemical/material into the lab, you **must ask before doing so**! 
Technically, this includes **unusual substrate materials**. We need to make sure we know how to handle, store and dispose of the material, and confirm compatibility/safety. 
Here's what you do: 
  1. Check to see if we stock something similar in our [Chemical List](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Chemical_List ""Chemical List""). If it's listed there then we have it and you just have to locate it for use. [Luis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Luis_Zuzunaga ""Luis Zuzunaga"") can help you with this.
  2. Contact [Brian Thibeault](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"") and let him know that you will be using this chemical (even if it was previously in the lab), to make sure we are ready for it. 
    1. Check to see if we have an MSDS already - if so, we have previously allowed this in the lab: [Chemical List](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Chemical_List ""Chemical List"")
    2. We'll let you know how to store/collect waste for your chemical.
  3. Make sure you have researched/understand the proper handling and use of this chemical - **that is YOUR responsibility!**
     * See the Lab Rules section about this: [Lab Rules: Chemicals in the Nanofab](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Lab_Rules#Chemicals_in_the_Nanofab)


## Computer/Tech Questions
### UCSB NetID Password Reset
If you need to reset your Net ID password, please do so by going to the following website: 
  * <https://www.im.ucsb.edu/idm/manage>
  * Select the `**University Affiliate**`option
  * Enter your Annex ID and Date Of Birth and select `**Reset UCSB Net ID password**`. Your Annex ID was provided to you when you first acquired your UCSB NetID, typically by email. Contact[Claudia](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Claudia_Gutierrez ""Claudia Gutierrez"") if you need your NetID Annex ID resent to you.
  * Once you reset your password, you will also need to re-enter this new password in your devices to get access to _eduroam_ Wifi internet access.


### How do I get my files from the NanoFab computers?
USB ports are disabled on NanoFab computers to prevent the spread of viruses. 
Instead, you can download your files from our **""Nanofiles"" SFTP** server. As long as you place your files into the proper directory on the tool computer, your files will be synced to the NanoFiles STFP server every hour (or immediately, by running the ""_Sync to NanoFiles_ "" script). You must save into a folder that is named according to your research group/company's name. Exact allowed folder names are found via the below instructions. 
For further information on how to access these files, where to place your files (allowed folder names for your Group) and login credentials, do the following: 
  * Log into [SignupMonkey](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu)
  * Click the **Files > [_Request Login Credentials_](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu/cgi-bin/users/get-nanofiles.cgi)** link.
  * The email you receive will give you instructions on accessing/syncing to the NanoFiles server, including _acceptable folder names_ you can use on the tool computers. 
    * Remember that _new folders_ only start syncing to the FTP at ~midnight, and hourly after that. see below for more info.
  * You can re-send this email any time by clicking the link on SignupMonkey.


#### Required Folder Names for Syncing
Our system requires that your files are stored in a correctly-named folder/directory on the Tool computer, corresponding to your company/group name. 
  * Click the above ""**[Request Login Credentials](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu/cgi-bin/users/get-nanofiles.cgi)** "" link, to receive an email that lists the allowed folder names.
  * You will _**not be able to retrieve your files**_ if the folder is incorrectly named or in the wrong location!


#### When will my FTP folder/files show up?
The first time you _create a folder for your group_ on a tool (or if you _change the folder name_), the server will only link to the new folder around midnight that night. So you’ll have to wait until the next morning for the tool to show up in your SFTP sessions 
After your folder has been created, the files will automatically sync every hour. 
We also have a shortcut on the tool desktops to sync immediately if needed. Run the ""_Nanofiles Sync_ "" shortcut on the desktop to perform the sync right away - your files will be available on the FTP server after that completes. 
#### I can't connect to the Nanofiles FTP server!
**Symptom** : Your SFTP client is suddenly unable to connect to the nanofiles server, with an error like ""_Network Error: Connection Refused_ "". This may also affect other people on the same network as you (who share the same external IP address.) 
**Cause:**
There are two ways your IP address can be automatically blocked: 
  1. You use the wrong password a few times, or
  2. Your FTP program tries to make too many connections, so fast that it looks like a 


**Solutions** : 
Email 
  1. Many FTP clients have the option to use ""_multiple connections_ "" or ""_simultaneous downloads_ "", which often gets your blocked _._ Set it to use **maximum 3 connections** (which means that you can Browse the folders while downloading two files). Turn off any options that look like they might open more than one connection to the server.
  2. Also turn off any ""_**Retry X number of times**_ "" options. 
    1. See these links for limiting the number of connections for 
    2. _**WinSCP**_ , in particular (and maybe Filezilla), **DEFAULTS** to use an _unlimited number of connections_ - so the first time you try to download many files at the same time _you will likely get blocked_. See the above links to prevent that.
    3. _**WinSCP**_ has TWO settings you need to reduce - one under the Bookmark/Connection settings, the other in the main Program Settings/Options. Look carefully for anything that would allow multiple connections or multiple retries and reduce/disable them.
    4. **CyberDuck** has multiple Preferences settings you need to change; in the **Preferences** : 
      1. Transfers > General > Transfer Files: **Open single connection**
      2. Connection > _UNcheck_ [_] **Repeat failed networking tasks**
  3. Save your password on your computer with a password manager. 
    1. Your FTP client may also be set to try many ""_reconnection attempts_ "" very fast. If the saved password is wrong, it will quickly reach the limit of authentication failures, and block your IP. Set your FTP client to never retry on failure, just in case it is due to a bad password.


### Wifi Access in the Nanofab
The Wifi networks ""_**UCSB Secure**_ "" (preferred) and ""_**UCSB Wireless**_ "" (will ask for login every time) and ""_**eduroam**_ "" (also works for other educational institutions) have full coverage in the NanoFab. All UC students/employees can use their NetID's to access these networks. External institutions can request a login from [Brian Thibeault](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault""). 
#### Cell Phone Calls
Verizon Wireless has three cellular repeaters installed in the cleanroom, available via UCSB agreements with the vendor. 
Cellular coverage is still not very good in some parts of the lab. However, Wifi Calling (aka. 
""Wifi calling"" is often not enabled by default, enable it as follows: 
It is recommended to use the WiFi network ""_**eduroam**_ "" for uninterrupted Wifi-Calling performance, although ""UCSB Secure"" also works. 
#### Forcing Calls to use Wifi (not Cellular)
_Sometimes your mobile device continues to use Cellular even though the signal is weaker than Wifi. The following forces your device to use Wifi only, by disabling the Cellular antenna._
  * Turn on ""Airplane Mode"" to disable the main cellular antennas.
  * While still in Airplane Mode, enable Wifi, and Bluetooth if using BT headphones. 
    * Connect to the UCSB Wifi Network, and BT devices if desired.
  * Place your call as usual - if WiFi Calling is enabled, the call will use Wifi. 
    * This applies to using internet calls as well, like WhatsApp, Skype, Facetime, Zoom etc. - your phone _may_ try to use the cellular connection for internet unless you disable it.
  * It can take up to 1min after enabling Wifi, for your phone to enable Wifi-Calling. Typically a symbol like ""VZW Wi-Fi"" or ""VoLTE"" indicates that Wifi-Calling is enabled.
  * When entering or leaving the cleanroom, it may be necessary to dis/reconnect your Wifi antenna in order to enable Wifi-Calling properly, due to your device switching between servers. All antennas in our cleanroom are on a mesh network, for uninterrupted calls throughout the lab.


### Can I add equipment reservations to my phone/computer/online calendar?
  * Yes, log into SignupMonkey, and on the ""Future Reservations"" column on the right, click on the ""iCalendar"" link. This links to a "".ics"" file that lists all your upcoming equipment reservations. Open this file to add the reservations to your calendar. [![Image showing the iCalendar "".ics"" file link on SignupMonkey](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/1/1e/SignupMonkey_-_Add_to_Calendar_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_3.55.11_PM.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:SignupMonkey_-_Add_to_Calendar_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_3.55.11_PM.png)The ""iCalendar"" (.ics) file link on SignupMonkeyUnfortunately deleted reservations will Not be removed from your calendar, because of the difficulty with CalDAV programming. I recommend having a separate calendar that you save your reservations onto.


#### Programmatically Accessing Reservation Data
  * To get a URL for accessing reservation data using a program, you can simply copy the URL to the *.ics iCal file mentioned above. This URL contains encrypted login info, so returns the *.ics file without requiring the GUI login form. You can get such a URL of your own future reservations as mentioned above. You can also get a custom search (for example all the future/past reservations from your research group) from the ""_Search_ "" section of Signup Monkey. The results page of any search includes a link at the top for the corresponding iCal file - copy that URL to use in your program/scripts.


## Processing/Fabrication Questions
### I need help using a tool, where do I get help?
There are so many little details to remember in the cleanroom, we all sometimes forget something or need a reminder. When in doubt, ask for help! 
  * First, check to see if printed instructions are found at the tool itself.
  * Second, check the Wiki page for that tool - many of our instruction sets and user manuals are posted on the [Tool page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tool_List ""Tool List"") in the Equipment section (see the left side bar).
  * Third, during business hours (eg. 7am-6pm) you can contact the tool maintainer. Contact info is posted on the glass walls above each tool.
  * Fourth (maybe first) option, look for an experienced user in the lab who might be able to help. Our users are typically very collaborative, knowledgeable and helpful! A senior member of your group is always a good option.


#### User Manuals
You can find user manuals for many of our tools, and software. Often times these are either 
  * Printed at the tool itself
  * In a PDF on the desktop of the tool's computer
  * On the [Nanofiles FTP](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_get_my_files_from_the_NanoFab_computers.3F) server in the ""Manuals"" folder. For example, complex analysis software such as the [Ellipsometer](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ellipsometer_\(Woollam\) ""Ellipsometer \(Woollam\)"") and [AFM](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Force_Microscope_\(Bruker_ICON\) ""Atomic Force Microscope \(Bruker ICON\)"") manuals are available on Nanofiles FTP.


### Where do I find a recipe for a process (litho/etch/dep etc.)?
The ""_Recipes and Data_ "" section on the left sidebar lists the different categories of recipes. In those pages, you can see whether a recipe exists for your process, and on which tool. We often include some basic characterization data on the recipes, but you should note that these are approximate only. _**If you have tight tolerances, you need to characterize the recipe yourself**_ (ie. figure out deposition/etch rate, selectivity, verticality etc.). 
For some recipes (etches in particular), we often post the parameter variations/recipe characterizations to show you how different recipe variables affect the etch. If you find that a provided recipe isn't exactly what you need, you can use this information to modify a copy of the recipe to suit your own needs. Please refer to the tool owner for creating your own recipes on each tool, especially for those that have a limited number of saved recipe slots. 
Many datasheets provide very usedul process info. For example, the datasheets for lithography photoresists/developers and solvents usually show spin curves (thickness vs. spin speed), exposure dose, bake times, resist profile vs. reflow temp etc. 
You can find photolithography datasheets on the [Chemical Datasheets](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Lithography_Recipes#Chemical_Datasheets) section of the Lithography Recipes page. 
### [Processing - How Do I…?](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Processing_-_How_Do_I%E2%80%A6%3F ""Processing - How Do I…?"")
The above page attempts to answer common fabrication questions that we have seen arise in user's fab processes. 
### A recipe is indicated as ""A"" (Available) or ""R1"" Rank #1 (done once); where do I find info on this recipe?
If a recipe is marked as ""A"", _Allowed_ on one of the recipe tables, this usually means that a graduate student has done this process at some point, but the NanoFab hasn't necessarily verified the process nor has the exact recipe and characterization. Contact anyone in the [Process Group](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Staff_List#Process_Group ""Staff List"") to get in contact with the research group that developed the recipe. 
### My Glassware/supplies are missing, how do I get them back?
Staff will occasionally collect glassware and supplies that are left out on the bench, after ensuring that the users (as indicated by the glassware labels) are not in the lab. The collected supplies are stored in a locked cabinet in Chase 4. 
**Any staff** can return your glassware - ask any staff to return your glassware. Staff will record the date/time of the collection, and your group may potentially be charged for the staff time. 
Please see the full policy collection here: 
[Lab Rules > **_Glassware Confiscation Policy_**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lab_Rules#Glassware_Confiscation_Policy ""Lab Rules"")

## Software
  * FIJI is an open source package, based on ImageJ, for scientific image analysis across many disciplines. 
    * Download here.


  * Microscope Measurement Tools (UCSB Fork) is a plug-in with pre-configured settings that provides the scaling factors for the UCSB NanoFab microscopes and SEMs. It also contains a script for drawing line measurements onto an image. 
    * This just automates the use of the `Set Scale...` built-in function.


## Installation
  1. Download the _MMT_ "" for the rest of the tutorial.)
  2. Install FIJI accordingly.
  3. Unzip the downloaded MMT zipfile. 
    1. Locate the _**Analyze**_ folder inside the package.
  4. Navigate to the FIJI _**Scripts**_ folder, in _**FIJI.app / plugins / Scripts**_

        
  * On Windows, the folder looks like this:

    [![Screenshot: Windows - Where to place the Analyze folder.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8c/MicroscopeMeasurementTools_-_FIJI_Install_Directory_-_WinXP.jpg/474px-MicroscopeMeasurementTools_-_FIJI_Install_Directory_-_WinXP.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MicroscopeMeasurementTools_-_FIJI_Install_Directory_-_WinXP.jpg)Windows - Where to place the Analyze folder.         
  * On Mac, first Right-click FIJI.app and choose ""_**Show Package Contents**_ "", and the folder will look like this:

    [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/50/MicroscopeMeasurementTools_-_FIJI_Install_-_Mac_Show_Package_Contents.png/209px-MicroscopeMeasurementTools_-_FIJI_Install_-_Mac_Show_Package_Contents.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MicroscopeMeasurementTools_-_FIJI_Install_-_Mac_Show_Package_Contents.png)     [![Screenshot: MacOS - Where to place the Analyze folder.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/24/FIJI_Install_Directory_-_MacOS.png/630px-FIJI_Install_Directory_-_MacOS.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:FIJI_Install_Directory_-_MacOS.png)MacOS - Where to place the Analyze folder.
  1. Copy the _**Analyze**_ folder from MMT into the FIJI _**Scripts**_ folder. 
    1. In the off chance that an _**Analyze**_ folder already exists in the FIJI scripts folder, merge the two rather than overwriting. You must have placed another script in the same menu location.
  2. (Re)Launch FIJI. 
    1. There should now be a new menu option in _**Analyze > Microscope Measurement Tools**_


### Add shortcut keys
Optionally add a shortcut key to execute the scripts. 
**To Do:** add steps  
---  
## Make a Measurement on an Image
  * Download an image from one of our microscopes on Nanofiles. 
    * You must know which microscope and **which objective the image was saved with**.
  * Open the image in FIJI (or open a copy to avoid overwriting the file)
  * Run the script _**Analyze > Microscope Measurement Tools > Choose Microscope Calibration...**_
  * Select the appropriate microscope and objective from the list and click _**OK**_
    * The calibration has now been applied to the image. Any FIJI functions will now use the correct scaling.
  * Enable the Line tool. Draw anywhere on the image you want to measure. 
    * While dragging, the _**(FIJI is just ImageJ)**_ control window will show the calibrated measurement value of your line.
  * To draw the measurement on the image, select the menu _**Analyze > Microscope Measurement Tools > Draw Measurement - Line**_
    * This can not be undone without reloading the image, so be sure to use _**Save As…**_.
    * You can make a new Overlay before applying the Drawing to make the line moveable or erasable.


## SEM Images
Images saved from the [JEOL SEM](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Field_Emission_SEM_2_\(JEOL_7600F\) ""Field Emission SEM 2 \(JEOL 7600F\)"") automatically save a Text file with the same name, which contains the scaling information. 
As long as this text file is kept in the same location as the image file, the function _**Choose Microscope Calibration >> JEOL SEM - AutoCal from TXT**_ will set the measurement scale appropriately.

# About
The Flexus instrument is used to measure the stress introduced onto a wafer after thin-film deposition by measuring local curvature of a wafer. The system uses a scanning laser detector configuration to measure the surface position of a wafer across its diameter. With automatic rotational control, a 3-D map can also be obtained. By comparing before and after measurements of the sample, the local stress of the sample can be calculated from the local curvature. The stage can also be heated up to 500°C to measure thermal mismatch of the thin films with the substrate. 
# Equipment Specifications
  * Measurement range is 2E7 to 4E7 dyne/cm2
  * Stress can also be measured as a function of time or temperature. The system has a temperature range from room temperature to 500°C.
  * Measurement results are organized in an easy to read spreadsheet format that can easily be exported to other data handling software such as Excel.
  * Windows 3.xx control and file storing
  * 3-D mapping
  * Laser/Detector Scanning Configuration
  * Substrates must be round and films must be reflective.
  * Fixtures are available for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6"" wafers. 8"" wafers can be ran as well without a fixture.

The Filmetrics F40-UV is a microscope-mounted thin-film measurement system, allowing you to non-destructively measure thin-film thicknesses in small (patterned) areas on your sample. The microscope is a standard Olympus BHJML metallurgical trinocular microscope. It is an optical reflectometer, acquiring reflection spectra between 400-900nm optical wavelengths (Vis to Near-IR) with a regular halogen microscope light source. The Filmetrics software then performs curve-fitting to determine the thickness and/or refractive index of the measured films. 
## Capabilities
  * Measure optically transparent thin-films down to ~30nm thickness.
  * Microscope Objectives: 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x, 150x 
    * Can measure thin-films in few-micron spot.
  * Acquire Optical Reflection Spectra from 400-900nm
  * Spectrometer/Detector is capable of detecting down to UV ~190nm, but light source does not support this wavelength.
  * Reflectivity curve-fitting for thin-film thickness analysis, supporting many common materials (Si3N4, SiO2 dielectrics, Si, GaAs, InP semiconductors, metals, photoresists etc.)
  * Approx ≥20nm film transparent measurement up to tens of microns.

## Examples
### Good Curve-Fitting
Do not believe your thickness measurements unless the red/blue curves show a reasonably good match!
[![example spectrum curve fit](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/4d/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_Measurement_screenshot_on_metal_pad_01.PNG/500px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_Measurement_screenshot_on_metal_pad_01.PNG)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_Measurement_screenshot_on_metal_pad_01.PNG)Screenshot showing 10x microscope view and optical spectrum/curve fitting of the SiO2 film thickness on top of Platinum contact metal. This is considered a ""reasonable"" fit because the curves are very similar, but don't overlay perfectly, giving only reasonable confidence in the reported numbers. [![example spectrum curve fit](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/c/c6/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_spectrum_curve_fit_07.jpg/300px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_spectrum_curve_fit_07.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_spectrum_curve_fit_07.jpg)A good fit should show the Calculated (red) curve overlay on top of the Measured (blue) curve. This is a very good curve-fit and the reported thickness/index should be accurate.
### Checking whether a dry etch is complete
The F40-UV is very useful for measuring whether a thin-film has been completely removed during a dry etch. This is similar to using [laser monitoring](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Laser_Etch_Monitoring ""Laser Etch Monitoring"") during the etch, except that the microscope enables you to measure inside small patterned areas that a laser monitor spot may not fit inside. 
In the following example, we are trying to etch away the SiO2 from on top of a Platinum contact metal. The 20x objective allows us to measure the SiO2 thickness on top of the Platinum as we continue to etch in 1 minute increments, measuring in between etches. 
Finally, when the SiO2 has been fully removed, we see that we can't get a good fit between the measured (blue) and simulated (red) data. 
Since the Platinum layer is thick enough to be opaque to visible light (>50nm), we just modelled this as SiO2 on top of Platinum, ignoring any other materials below the platinum. 
[![Example Screenshot of incomplete SiO2 etch](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/22/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_SiO_Etch_4m%2B4m_-_Incomplete_Etch.png/400px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_SiO_Etch_4m%2B4m_-_Incomplete_Etch.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_SiO_Etch_4m%2B4m_-_Incomplete_Etch.png)Incomplete Dry-Etch, showing some residual SiO2 left. ""Goodness of Fit"" is close to 1.0 in the results pane, and the red+blue curves match closely so we believe the measurement. |  [![Example screenshot of fully removed SiO2 etch](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/29/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_2018-11-08_-_SiO_Etch_4m%2B4m%2B1m_-_Fully_Removed.png/400px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_2018-11-08_-_SiO_Etch_4m%2B4m%2B1m_-_Fully_Removed.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_2018-11-08_-_SiO_Etch_4m%2B4m%2B1m_-_Fully_Removed.png)After re-etching, measurement shows bad fit (red and blue curves), and ""Goodness of Fit"" = 0 in the results pane. The thickness value shown is not real, and this indicates that the SiO2 film has been fully removed since no parameter can give a good fit.

Load ""_**Filmetrics Focus / Reference Wafer**_ "" onto stage, avoiding hole [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/b1/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_wafer_placement_03.jpg/200px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_wafer_placement_03.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_wafer_placement_03.jpg)Approximate placement of a 4-inch wafer
  5. Rotate uScope turret to desired microscope objective
  6. Focus on wafer - use edge of blue (SiO2) features
  7. In ""**Live Video** "" tab, make sure wafer is in focus, and black spot (measurement region) is on grey Silicon region only.[![""Live Video"" tab showing focused wafer](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/6/6c/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_focus_on_bare_silicon_04.jpg/200px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_focus_on_bare_silicon_04.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_focus_on_bare_silicon_04.jpg)Focus on the bare silicon in the FILMeasure software, for Si Reference scan
  8. Set software to use appropriate Objective calibration from dropdown list, eg. ""10x""[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/4f/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_objective_choice_05.jpg/200px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_objective_choice_05.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_objective_choice_05.jpg)Choose objective calibration in software
  9. Click **[Baseline…]** , set to ""**Si** "" and **[Take Reflectance Standard]** & **[Next-- >]**
    1. If a warning about intensity change pops up, ignore it and hit **[OK]**
  10. Move stage so microscope shoots through hole in stage
  11. Click **[Take Background]** & **[Finish]**[![microscope aiming through hole in stage](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/de/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_dark_meas_thru_hole_06.jpg/200px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_dark_meas_thru_hole_06.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_dark_meas_thru_hole_06.jpg) For Background measurement, aim the microscope through the hole in the stage.


### Sample Measurement
  1. Focus on your sample/feature of interest & place the black aperture spot on the measurement region. Here we will measure the SiO2 on the Filmetrics Reference Wafer. 
    1. It is ok to change the objective, just make sure the same calibrated objective is chosen before measuring.
  2. Select a recipe from the Dropdown list (ok to _discard changes_), and Click **[Edit Recipe…]** to set the layers to approximately what you expect to measure. 
    1. Enable the checkbox next to the thicknesses you want it to measure/calculate, and Disable checkboxes next to any values you want the software to use pre-programmed values for.
    2. Optionally enable the check box next to **n** & **k** - but only if you know what refractive index and extinction you expect. If you don't know these values, Disable the ""Meas"" checkbox for n & k. When enabled, you'll want to make sure the calculated refractive index (n) is close to the expected value.
  3. **Re-Select the correct microscope objective** & Click **[Measure]**
  4. Make sure the blue (measured) and red (calc'd) curves have reasonably good agreement. Goodness of fit >90% is pretty good. Refractive Index (n), if calc'd, should be near the expected value for the film. 
    1. If fit is bad (low GoF) or refractive index is far off, this measurement is inaccurate. If Red curve is much too wavy or too smooth, then your guess of thickness was not close enough - **[Edit Recipe]** & **[Analyze]** again until you get a good fit.
    2. Don't hesitate to ask [Ning](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ning_Cao ""Ning Cao"") or [Demis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for help with the curve-fitting, it can be complicated!

        [![example spectrum curve fit](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/c/c6/Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_spectrum_curve_fit_07.jpg/300px-Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_spectrum_curve_fit_07.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Filmetrics_F40-UV_-_spectrum_curve_fit_07.jpg)A good fit should show the Calculated (red) curve overlay on top of the Measureed (blue) curve.
### ShutDown
  1. Set objective to 10x & Remove Sample
  2. **TURN OFF THE LIGHT SOURCE**
    1. The halogen light source does die eventually, so prolong the life by turning off when not in use.
    2. If doing repeated measurements, leave a note with date/time.

  4. Click **FILMapper** icon to open the software, and let it finish the Initialization process (**Be very careful: the stage will move rapidly during the initialization**).
  5. Click **Wafer Map** tab, then, choose a recipe from the drop-down menu, e.g., **SiO2 on Si** , then, click **Edit** button to edit the recipe to fit to your film(s)/wafer measurement (you can save the recipe into a different name when the edit is done by clicking the **Save Recipe as Different Filename** icon at the top-left corner). 
    1. Click **Film Stack** tab: A) Choose the thickness unit from the drop-down menu; B) Choose the film(s) and substrate of your film(s)/wafer from the drop-down menus, C) Input the constraints of optical constants (±n and ±k), then, tick the small square box besides under **Meas** (if you want to map the optical constants); D) Input film nominal thickness value (the best guess), then, tick the small square box besides; E) Input the constraint value in percentage of the nominal thickness under **Grading** , then, tick the small square box besides.
    2. Click **Analysis Option** tab: under **Data Selection: Wavelength Range** , choose either **Displayed data** or **Fixed range** (you can choose the wavelength range to fit to your reflectance data); under **Smoothing** Optical thickness, input 60 m in the box; under **Source Data Analyze using (if present),** choose **Reflectance 0 o**.
    3. Click **Alarms:** you can input a minimum valid GOF so that there will be an alarm if the value of GOF is below this value. Also, if you want to be alert about unusual film thickness, then, tick the small square box beside **Activate alarm** , and input the minimum and maximum values into the boxes.
    4. Click **Wafer Map:**
      1. Under **Measurement Configuration** , choose **Wafer Diameter** from the drop-down menu; choose **Coordinate system** from the drop-down menu (e.g., **Polar** , then, choose Number of Points from the drop-down menu); input **Edge exclusion** (e.g., 3 mm); A) “**Indexing** : changes plot on screen to show appropriate index mark. **The wafer should be oriented on the stage with the index mark on the edge opposite the mirrors** (i.e. the top of the wafer in the map results is near the mirror).”B) “**Advanced Settings** : When using a rectangular map, the advanced rectangular map settings option is enabled for use. This menu allows the user to define the sample origin point in one of five locations; top-left, top-right, center, bottom-left, or bottom-right. **Automatic Alignment** can be used to help find the edges of the sample.”
      2. “**Offset Map Origin** : This feature is intended to allow the end user to determine the origin point the system will use the measurement map. if no option is selected, the software will default to centering all maps around the (0, 0) measurement location. Once selected there are two options available: A) **Relative to Start Location-** Whenever the **Start** button is clicked, the software uses the current (x, y) position as the origin for the map. This position is not saved as part of the recipe; B) **Absolute-** set a specific (x, y) location as the origin of the map.”
      3. “**Automatic Data Saving** : If a filename is entered in the upper right corner of the **Wafer Map View >Map Information** field, then a new folder with that name will appear in the FILMapper\Map Results folder. If no name is specified, all saved data will appear in the Map results folder. A) **Save Results to Disk:** Automatically saves the map after completion of measurement. Depending on the settings underneath Setup>Options>Wafer Map, the software will either save the maps as a **.fimap** (all mapping data, opened using Excel) or a **.fiwmc** file; B) **Save Spectra** : Saves the spectrum acquired at each point as a separate file. Each file is saved in measurement order, “0” being the first measurement. File extension is **.fmspe** by default, but can be set underneath the tab **Setup >Options>Wafer Map**. Each spectrum may be opened in the Measure Tab.”
      4. “**Pattern Avoidance:** The pattern avoidance feature enables the system to target areas on a patterned wafer that do not scatter light (i.e. avoid trench areas). If a measurement shows low reflectance, the stage will move to a nearby location where a pad is expected (as defined by the settings described below). This feature should not be selected when measuring blanket wafers. A) **Spot Size:** the size of the measured spot; B) **Pattern Size:** The size of the features to be avoided; C) **Rectangular, Radial** : The pattern layout geometry; D) **Spacing:** The center-to-center separation of elements making up the pattern.”
      5. “**Invalid Measurement Retry:** Activating this feature allows the software to try up to four additional measurement locations, within the **Spot Size** specified if the first measurement turns up as invalid. Invalid measurements are defined by the minimum valid GOF in the **Alarms** tab. If a valid measurement is found, the result will be shown on the resulting map. If no valid measurement is found in any location, the spot will be marked invalid. This function is especially helpful when measuring non-uniform samples.”
      6. “**Additional Parameters To Be Mapped:** Average Reflectance Ratio: This maps the average reflectance ratio, which is defined as the average reflectance between the **Starting Wavelength** and the **Ending wavelength** , divided by the reflectance at the specified **Reference Wavelength**.”
      7. “**GOF (Solve for Goodness of Fit):** Enabling this feature saves GOF results with the map.” To see the GOF map, use the drop down menu under **Display** (on the right side of the screen).
      8. ‘**Full Wafer Reference Mode:** This option allows you to choose whether or not to enable _Full Wafer Reference Mode_ , or to let the software decide based on the parameters set to be solved for. A full wafer reference is suggested when mapping for optical constants, or very thin films (<50nm).”
    5. Click **Acquisition Settings:**
      1. **Use Recommended sampling Time:** Selecting this option uses the sampling time that has been automatically calculated by the software during the baseline procedure. The displayed value is the total sampling time and not necessarily the integration time.
      2. “**Use Manually Set Parameters:** Users can set a maximum sampling time by selecting this option. By increasing sampling time the user may see a decrease in signal noise, but at the trade-off of a longer acquisition time. Integration time and cycles will still be determined by the FILMapper software.
      3. “**Use Manually Set Parameters:** User can set both the integration time per acquisition cycle and the number of integration cycles over which to average. When using this option, the total sampling time is equal to the integration time multiplied by the number of integration cycles.
    6. Click **Apply** button, then, **OK** button to finish the recipe edit
  6. **Baseline:**
    1. Click **Baseline** tab, following the instruction on the screen:

# About
The system is a Plasma-Therm 770 SLR series system with a loadlock, dedicated to fluorine-based gases (system aka. ""FL-ICP""). The system has an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) coil and a capactively coupled substrate RF supply to independently control plasma density and ion energy in the system. Helium back-side cooling is available to keep the sample cool during the etch. The system is fully computer controlled in all aspects of the pumping cycles and process control, and can be programmed by the user. 
The system is generally meant for any fluorine-containing etch, which is typically for etching materials like SiO2, Si3N4, Silicon, or other materials with volatile fluoride etch products. 
The fixturing is configured for 4"" diameter Si wafers and uses a ceramic clamp on the outer ~5mm of the 100mm wafer to hold the sample on the RF chuck. 
Smaller samples can be mounted onto 100mm carrier wafers, either with no adhesive (sample temperature will be higher), or with Santovac oil for better thermal cooling. However, _great care must be taken_ to ensure no oil, photoresist or small pieces are placed on the outer 5mm of the carrier wafer, as the ceramic clamp will physically press on this outer region, potentially causing stiction or wafer breakage if foreign or sticky substances are in those regions. 
The in-situ [laser monitor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Laser_Etch_Monitoring ""Laser Etch Monitoring"") installed on the chamber allows for repeatable etches and endpoint detection via continuous optical monitoring of the wafer reflectivity in a user-determined location, through a porthole on the chamber. 
# Detailed Specifications
  * 1000 W ICP coil power at 2 MHz and 500 W substrate bias at 13.56 MHz plasma generators
  * C4F8, SF6, O2, Ar, N2, CHF3, CF4 gases available
  * He-back-side cooling, 10°C std. chuck temp.
  * Single 100mm/4-inch wafer handling with physical topside clamp, contacting outer 5mm of wafer. 
    * Small samples may be mounted with oil or no adhesive, but must be far away from this 5mm edge exclusion zone.
    * No photoresist or oil is allowed to contact the clamp, or wafers will get stuck and possibly break in the chamber.
  * Windows-based computer control of process and wafer handling 
    * Easy to chain recipes via ""Batch"" programming, eg. _SiO2 Etch / Si Etch / PR strip_ in a single load.
  * [Laser endpoint monitoring](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Laser_Etch_Monitoring ""Laser Etch Monitoring"") with camera and simulation software, for repeatable etching - see: [Intellemetrics LEP 500](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Laser_Etch_Monitoring ""Laser Etch Monitoring"")

### Process Control Data
We have two different EtchCals on this tool: 
#### SiO2 Etching
_We have found that SiO 2 etching is fairly insensitive to chamber condition._
#### **Si Etching**
_This Si etch is much more sensitive to chamber condition, allowing us to detect chamber contamination faster._

## General NanoFab Questions
### How do I get access to the lab?
See the [Services](https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/services) page and click on the appropriate entity (universtiy/company etc.) to see the process and paperwork needed for your staff to access our lab in-person. The [_hourly rates_](https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/services#comp-k3rx7hk4) are also listed on this page. External universities and companies are welcome to access our lab. 
#### Can staff perform fabrication for us?
Yes, for certain types of jobs. [_See this page for more info_](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Services#Fabrication_Services_by_NanoFab_Staff ""Services""). 
### Who do I contact for an equipment problem or general NanoFab problem?
For _general_ NanoFab issues (that affect the whole NanoFab), please contact the [Lab Director (click for contact info)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"") by email or phone. 
It's **much** better to quickly let us know of a mistake or problem proactively, and let us help you fix it! 
#### Emergencies
For immediate or health-related emergencies, call 9-911 from any of the phones in the lab, or 911 from your cell phone. Let them know that you are in **""Engineering Sciences Building #225""** at **""Room #1102 - Gowning Room""**. 
#### Specific Equipment Problem
Always notify maintainers _**immediately**_ of any unusual problem that may affect other tool users, and also _record it in the logbook_! 
  1. If you are having trouble with a piece of equipment, please contact the supervisor of that tool **first**. The supervisor's contact information can be found posted on the walls above/behind the equipment, on the [tool page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tool_List ""Tool List"") and on the tool's SignupMonkey page. 
    1. If you need immediate assistance _during business hours_ , you may call/text the tool supervisor's cell phone number, otherwise use their office phone or email.
    2. If the tool is down, please place a note at the tool in addition to reporting the issue.
  2. If the engineer is not available, please go to the tool's signup page on [SignupMonkey](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu) and click the ""**_Report a Tool Issue_** "" button. This emails all Nanofab Staff _and_ all users with future reservations _and_ texts the tool supervisor. This is the preferred method for getting help if the supervisor is not immediately available.
  3. If the tool is not on SignupMonkey, **email the NanoFab Staff at**. This emails all staff, so anyone available can help you.


#### Contact all NanoFab Staff by Email
The entire NanoFab staff can be emailed at 
#### NanoFab On-Call Staff
For after-hours and weekend emergency situations, please call **[** to contact the staff member that is on-call. This is for major issues/emergencies that will affect many users, such as alarms, leaks, wet bench, fume hood issues etc. Please do not call this number for problems with a single process tool that only affects a few users, instead see above. 
### After Hours Access
To enter the facility after hours, please use the **South-facing** entrance. There is a card/Symmetry reader on that exterior door. 
We DO NOT provide after hours access to the main doors on the West entrance. 
### Publications acknowledging the Nanofab
If you publish on devices or work done using the NanoFab, please add an acknowledgement or line of text stating the following (or similar):
> _A portion of this work was performed in the UCSB Nanofabrication Facility, an open access laboratory._
This is important for the continued success of the Nanofabrication Facility. This applies to local UCSB researchers as well. 
#### Authorship on Publications
If a UCSB staff scientist contributed significant research & development effort (including thinking through fabrication methods), or if you include their data/images in your paper, especially if novel work was developed, you should seriously consider **adding them as an author** (while also retaining the above Acknowledgement). Many journals require **all** contributing authors to be cited. For example, consider the _all_ contributions to the work. 
Analysis code authored by staff 
Even for repeat processes performed by our staff, it may be appropriate to include the UCSB Staff member that performed the fabrication - a number of local research groups and companies always include the person who fabricated the devices as authors. Since this is research and development, not a guaranteed off-the-shelf product, every run requires experience to produce good results for your research. 
You can specify that the staff member only performed fabrication and process development. 
Process knowledge gained from conversations, advice and brainstorming sessions may also constitute significant ""intellectual contribution"", and warrant authorship, or be worthy of an acknowledgement. 
Feel free to [contact us](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"") if you would like to discuss any of these points, and thank you for understanding. 
### What Supplies do I need to bring to the lab?

The lab provides the following to our users at no additional charge: 
  * Storage boxes for use within the lab (not to be removed from lab without permission)
  * [Chemicals](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Chemical_List ""Chemical List"") including a selection of photoresists, developers, acids, bases and solvents.
  * Metal sources for evaporation and sputter. We don't have every metal, check with staff to see if we have the metal you need.
  * Cleanroom-compatible notebooks and paper.
  * Ziplock bags / vacuum seal bags.
  * Safety goggles - you are welcome to provide your own as long as they are ANSI Z.87 rated.
  * All gowning supplies (hoods/gown/boot covers/masks/gloves etc.)
  * Lab Consumables such as napkins, pipettes, tins, razor blades, glass slides, swabs etc.


We highly recommend to take your notes on a digital platform such as tablet/laptop that is portable for use within the lab. Small tablets with pens work very well. <135mm will fit in the gown pockets. 
### Can I take supplies from the Nanofab?
Generally **NO**! The napkins, tote boxes, bottles, flashlights, tools and all other supplies are **nanofab property!** You are NOT allowed to take any of our supplies to your lab without asking us first. Please do ask staff if there is some supply you'd like to borrow or take, we are usually happy to help. 
#### Where do I get these supplies for my lab?
For UCSB users, the [Physics](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/resources/materialsmanagement/storeroom) and [Chemistry](https://www.chem.ucsb.edu/facilities-services#storerooms) store rooms sell many common supplies we use, including tweezers, beakers/dishes etc. Otherwise you can search any standard supplier for what you need (Thermo-Fischer Scientific, Mcmaster-Carr, Entegris, Techni-Tool etc. etc.). Ask NanoFab staff if you need something quickly and we can probably help you, or tell you where to purchase the appropriate supplies. 
### Bring a new chemical/material into the lab
If you need to bring a new chemical/material into the lab, you **must ask before doing so**! 
Technically, this includes **unusual substrate materials**. We need to make sure we know how to handle, store and dispose of the material, and confirm compatibility/safety. 
Here's what you do: 
  1. Check to see if we stock something similar in our [Chemical List](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Chemical_List ""Chemical List""). If it's listed there then we have it and you just have to locate it for use. [Luis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Luis_Zuzunaga ""Luis Zuzunaga"") can help you with this.
  2. Contact [Brian Thibeault](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"") and let him know that you will be using this chemical (even if it was previously in the lab), to make sure we are ready for it. 
    1. Check to see if we have an MSDS already - if so, we have previously allowed this in the lab: [Chemical List](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Chemical_List ""Chemical List"")
    2. We'll let you know how to store/collect waste for your chemical.
  3. Make sure you have researched/understand the proper handling and use of this chemical - **that is YOUR responsibility!**
     * See the Lab Rules section about this: [Lab Rules: Chemicals in the Nanofab](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Lab_Rules#Chemicals_in_the_Nanofab)


## Computer/Tech Questions
### UCSB NetID Password Reset
If you need to reset your Net ID password, please do so by going to the following website: 
  * <https://www.im.ucsb.edu/idm/manage>
  * Select the `**University Affiliate**`option
  * Enter your Annex ID and Date Of Birth and select `**Reset UCSB Net ID password**`. Your Annex ID was provided to you when you first acquired your UCSB NetID, typically by email. Contact[Claudia](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Claudia_Gutierrez ""Claudia Gutierrez"") if you need your NetID Annex ID resent to you.
  * Once you reset your password, you will also need to re-enter this new password in your devices to get access to _eduroam_ Wifi internet access.


### How do I get my files from the NanoFab computers?
USB ports are disabled on NanoFab computers to prevent the spread of viruses. 
Instead, you can download your files from our **""Nanofiles"" SFTP** server. As long as you place your files into the proper directory on the tool computer, your files will be synced to the NanoFiles STFP server every hour (or immediately, by running the ""_Sync to NanoFiles_ "" script). You must save into a folder that is named according to your research group/company's name. Exact allowed folder names are found via the below instructions. 
For further information on how to access these files, where to place your files (allowed folder names for your Group) and login credentials, do the following: 
  * Log into [SignupMonkey](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu)
  * Click the **Files > [_Request Login Credentials_](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu/cgi-bin/users/get-nanofiles.cgi)** link.
  * The email you receive will give you instructions on accessing/syncing to the NanoFiles server, including _acceptable folder names_ you can use on the tool computers. 
    * Remember that _new folders_ only start syncing to the FTP at ~midnight, and hourly after that. see below for more info.
  * You can re-send this email any time by clicking the link on SignupMonkey.


#### Required Folder Names for Syncing
Our system requires that your files are stored in a correctly-named folder/directory on the Tool computer, corresponding to your company/group name. 
  * Click the above ""**[Request Login Credentials](https://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu/cgi-bin/users/get-nanofiles.cgi)** "" link, to receive an email that lists the allowed folder names.
  * You will _**not be able to retrieve your files**_ if the folder is incorrectly named or in the wrong location!


#### When will my FTP folder/files show up?
The first time you _create a folder for your group_ on a tool (or if you _change the folder name_), the server will only link to the new folder around midnight that night. So you’ll have to wait until the next morning for the tool to show up in your SFTP sessions 
After your folder has been created, the files will automatically sync every hour. 
We also have a shortcut on the tool desktops to sync immediately if needed. Run the ""_Nanofiles Sync_ "" shortcut on the desktop to perform the sync right away - your files will be available on the FTP server after that completes. 
#### I can't connect to the Nanofiles FTP server!
**Symptom** : Your SFTP client is suddenly unable to connect to the nanofiles server, with an error like ""_Network Error: Connection Refused_ "". This may also affect other people on the same network as you (who share the same external IP address.) 
**Cause:**
There are two ways your IP address can be automatically blocked: 
  1. You use the wrong password a few times, or
  2. Your FTP program tries to make too many connections, so fast that it looks like a 


**Solutions** : 
Email 
  1. Many FTP clients have the option to use ""_multiple connections_ "" or ""_simultaneous downloads_ "", which often gets your blocked _._ Set it to use **maximum 3 connections** (which means that you can Browse the folders while downloading two files). Turn off any options that look like they might open more than one connection to the server.
  2. Also turn off any ""_**Retry X number of times**_ "" options. 
    1. See these links for limiting the number of connections for 
    2. _**WinSCP**_ , in particular (and maybe Filezilla), **DEFAULTS** to use an _unlimited number of connections_ - so the first time you try to download many files at the same time _you will likely get blocked_. See the above links to prevent that.
    3. _**WinSCP**_ has TWO settings you need to reduce - one under the Bookmark/Connection settings, the other in the main Program Settings/Options. Look carefully for anything that would allow multiple connections or multiple retries and reduce/disable them.
    4. **CyberDuck** has multiple Preferences settings you need to change; in the **Preferences** : 
      1. Transfers > General > Transfer Files: **Open single connection**
      2. Connection > _UNcheck_ [_] **Repeat failed networking tasks**
  3. Save your password on your computer with a password manager. 
    1. Your FTP client may also be set to try many ""_reconnection attempts_ "" very fast. If the saved password is wrong, it will quickly reach the limit of authentication failures, and block your IP. Set your FTP client to never retry on failure, just in case it is due to a bad password.


### Wifi Access in the Nanofab
The Wifi networks ""_**UCSB Secure**_ "" (preferred) and ""_**UCSB Wireless**_ "" (will ask for login every time) and ""_**eduroam**_ "" (also works for other educational institutions) have full coverage in the NanoFab. All UC students/employees can use their NetID's to access these networks. External institutions can request a login from [Brian Thibeault](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault""). 
#### Cell Phone Calls
Verizon Wireless has three cellular repeaters installed in the cleanroom, available via UCSB agreements with the vendor. 
Cellular coverage is still not very good in some parts of the lab. However, Wifi Calling (aka. 
""Wifi calling"" is often not enabled by default, enable it as follows: 
It is recommended to use the WiFi network ""_**eduroam**_ "" for uninterrupted Wifi-Calling performance, although ""UCSB Secure"" also works. 
#### Forcing Calls to use Wifi (not Cellular)
_Sometimes your mobile device continues to use Cellular even though the signal is weaker than Wifi. The following forces your device to use Wifi only, by disabling the Cellular antenna._
  * Turn on ""Airplane Mode"" to disable the main cellular antennas.
  * While still in Airplane Mode, enable Wifi, and Bluetooth if using BT headphones. 
    * Connect to the UCSB Wifi Network, and BT devices if desired.
  * Place your call as usual - if WiFi Calling is enabled, the call will use Wifi. 
    * This applies to using internet calls as well, like WhatsApp, Skype, Facetime, Zoom etc. - your phone _may_ try to use the cellular connection for internet unless you disable it.
  * It can take up to 1min after enabling Wifi, for your phone to enable Wifi-Calling. Typically a symbol like ""VZW Wi-Fi"" or ""VoLTE"" indicates that Wifi-Calling is enabled.
  * When entering or leaving the cleanroom, it may be necessary to dis/reconnect your Wifi antenna in order to enable Wifi-Calling properly, due to your device switching between servers. All antennas in our cleanroom are on a mesh network, for uninterrupted calls throughout the lab.


### Can I add equipment reservations to my phone/computer/online calendar?
  * Yes, log into SignupMonkey, and on the ""Future Reservations"" column on the right, click on the ""iCalendar"" link. This links to a "".ics"" file that lists all your upcoming equipment reservations. Open this file to add the reservations to your calendar. [![Image showing the iCalendar "".ics"" file link on SignupMonkey](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/1/1e/SignupMonkey_-_Add_to_Calendar_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_3.55.11_PM.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:SignupMonkey_-_Add_to_Calendar_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_3.55.11_PM.png)The ""iCalendar"" (.ics) file link on SignupMonkeyUnfortunately deleted reservations will Not be removed from your calendar, because of the difficulty with CalDAV programming. I recommend having a separate calendar that you save your reservations onto.


#### Programmatically Accessing Reservation Data
  * To get a URL for accessing reservation data using a program, you can simply copy the URL to the *.ics iCal file mentioned above. This URL contains encrypted login info, so returns the *.ics file without requiring the GUI login form. You can get such a URL of your own future reservations as mentioned above. You can also get a custom search (for example all the future/past reservations from your research group) from the ""_Search_ "" section of Signup Monkey. The results page of any search includes a link at the top for the corresponding iCal file - copy that URL to use in your program/scripts.


## Processing/Fabrication Questions
### I need help using a tool, where do I get help?
There are so many little details to remember in the cleanroom, we all sometimes forget something or need a reminder. When in doubt, ask for help! 
  * First, check to see if printed instructions are found at the tool itself.
  * Second, check the Wiki page for that tool - many of our instruction sets and user manuals are posted on the [Tool page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tool_List ""Tool List"") in the Equipment section (see the left side bar).
  * Third, during business hours (eg. 7am-6pm) you can contact the tool maintainer. Contact info is posted on the glass walls above each tool.
  * Fourth (maybe first) option, look for an experienced user in the lab who might be able to help. Our users are typically very collaborative, knowledgeable and helpful! A senior member of your group is always a good option.


#### User Manuals
You can find user manuals for many of our tools, and software. Often times these are either 
  * Printed at the tool itself
  * In a PDF on the desktop of the tool's computer
  * On the [Nanofiles FTP](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_get_my_files_from_the_NanoFab_computers.3F) server in the ""Manuals"" folder. For example, complex analysis software such as the [Ellipsometer](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ellipsometer_\(Woollam\) ""Ellipsometer \(Woollam\)"") and [AFM](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Force_Microscope_\(Bruker_ICON\) ""Atomic Force Microscope \(Bruker ICON\)"") manuals are available on Nanofiles FTP.


### Where do I find a recipe for a process (litho/etch/dep etc.)?
The ""_Recipes and Data_ "" section on the left sidebar lists the different categories of recipes. In those pages, you can see whether a recipe exists for your process, and on which tool. We often include some basic characterization data on the recipes, but you should note that these are approximate only. _**If you have tight tolerances, you need to characterize the recipe yourself**_ (ie. figure out deposition/etch rate, selectivity, verticality etc.). 
For some recipes (etches in particular), we often post the parameter variations/recipe characterizations to show you how different recipe variables affect the etch. If you find that a provided recipe isn't exactly what you need, you can use this information to modify a copy of the recipe to suit your own needs. Please refer to the tool owner for creating your own recipes on each tool, especially for those that have a limited number of saved recipe slots. 
Many datasheets provide very usedul process info. For example, the datasheets for lithography photoresists/developers and solvents usually show spin curves (thickness vs. spin speed), exposure dose, bake times, resist profile vs. reflow temp etc. 
You can find photolithography datasheets on the [Chemical Datasheets](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Lithography_Recipes#Chemical_Datasheets) section of the Lithography Recipes page. 
### [Processing - How Do I…?](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Processing_-_How_Do_I%E2%80%A6%3F ""Processing - How Do I…?"")
The above page attempts to answer common fabrication questions that we have seen arise in user's fab processes. 
### A recipe is indicated as ""A"" (Available) or ""R1"" Rank #1 (done once); where do I find info on this recipe?
If a recipe is marked as ""A"", _Allowed_ on one of the recipe tables, this usually means that a graduate student has done this process at some point, but the NanoFab hasn't necessarily verified the process nor has the exact recipe and characterization. Contact anyone in the [Process Group](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Staff_List#Process_Group ""Staff List"") to get in contact with the research group that developed the recipe. 
### My Glassware/supplies are missing, how do I get them back?
Staff will occasionally collect glassware and supplies that are left out on the bench, after ensuring that the users (as indicated by the glassware labels) are not in the lab. The collected supplies are stored in a locked cabinet in Chase 4. 
**Any staff** can return your glassware - ask any staff to return your glassware. Staff will record the date/time of the collection, and your group may potentially be charged for the staff time. 
Please see the full policy collection here:

  * Just click the ""[Create an Account](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount)"" link in the corner of the page,
  * Fill in your info, making sure you _**use the same email address you use for SignupMonkey.**_
  * Then click the link in the confirmation email you receive.
  * You will then be able to log in and edit many of the wiki pages. We encourage you to make updates or add your processes!


Contact the [Wiki Admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") if you need help. 
### How do I edit a page?
First, you need to login by clicking the “Log In” link in the top-right corner of the page. 
Then you simply click _[Edit]_ on a page you wish to change. The _[Edit]_ option will only be available for pages that you are authorized to change, which does not include all pages. 
_[Edit]_ brings up the _Visual Editor_ , which allows you to type directly into a page without editing any code, like using a regular word processing program. The Visual Editor is the recommended method. Alternatively, _[Edit Source]_ will show you the wiki markup code for the page, which is also an acceptable way to edit a page but much less intuitive. 
Please see the [Editing Tutorials](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Editing_Tutorials ""Editing Tutorials"") for more information on editing a page. 
Note that NanoFab users are only allowed to edit certain pages, and have some restrictions on their accounts for security purposes. However we do encourage all updates and changes, so please contact the [Wiki Admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") if you need help, such as making a new page, uploading images etc. The giant materials/recipe tables are only editable by Admins, so let us know if you have a new recipe/material to add! 
### ""_Something went wrong_ "" while saving my edits! How do I keep my edits?
Sometimes the server will log you out after a long time, even while you are still editing a page! 
Then when you try to save the page you might get an error like ""_**Something Went Wrong: We could not save your edits because the session is no longer valid...**_ "". 
If this happens, DO NOT CLOSE your edited page or you may lose your edits! Instead do the following: 
  1. Hit ""Resume editing"" on the edited page, to close the ""Save Page"" dialogue.
  2. Open a NEW web browser window,
  3. Go to the [NanoFab wiki](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin) in that new window,
  4. [Login to the wiki](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin) on that window (you can click the link to go to the Login page directly)
  5. On your edited page, Click ""**Save Page** "" again, and after dismissing the error click ""**Try Again** "". You may need to press **Try Again** a few times until it figures out that you have logged in, and it will then save your edits.


### What do I do if I find an error on the wiki?
If you locate a mistake, error or typo, log in and make the change yourself, or let staff know. Staff will see your edits and approve them. 
If you don't have edit permission, let

**[Photomask Ordering Procedure for UCSB Users](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photomask_Ordering_Procedure_for_UCSB_Users ""Photomask Ordering Procedure for UCSB Users"")** - see this page for how to submit your order into the purchasing system. 
## Mask Layout / Alignment Marks / Ordering from Photronics / Specifications
1) Mask specifications to Photronics using old Connexant order form 
The following material should be sent to them to do a job: 
1. Mask file in GDSII format, upload by FTP. Site: “dragon.photronics.com or 207.77.140.1”, Get your own Username/Password from Photronics. 
2. The mask file should be the same scale size as will appear on the mask (ie. 5x scale). The features on the wafer will be 5 x smaller. L-Edit has a feature to scale dimensions so that the original mask file can be made with the correct on-wafer dimensions and then the job can be scaled and saved as a separate file. Each layer in the document must have a unique GDSII number assigned to it. These numbers are used by Photronics. 
3. You must send a purchase order and put a part number on the order form. The part number is anything you make up and will appear on the mask. 
4. You need to fill out a Connexant Photomask Order form (2 pages). Most fields you will fill in are obvious. Here are the meanings of the not-so-obvious ones. 
_Media Type_ : “FTP” is the answer for electronically sent data. 
_Data Scale_ : “1 x” is the correct answer if the mask layout dimensions sent are those that will be on the mask (remember that the GCA Steppers will shrink these dimensions by 5 times on the wafer) 
_Material :_ Quartz 
_Material Size_ : 5” x 5” x .09” 
_C.D. Feature Type_ : “rectangle” is usually the correct answer 
_Data Extents Xlow, Ylow, Xhigh, and Yhigh_ : In the L-edit mask file, these are the box coordinates, in microns from the origin, of a box that just contains all of the features in the mask. 
_Reticle/Mask Level I.D_ : The name of the level 
**To Do:** clarify what this is called in L-Edit or KLayout terminology  
---  
_Topcell Structure Name_ : The Name of the Cell in the GDS file that contains the data to be printed on the mask. 
_Add. Unit_ : This is the address unit size (step size) of the raster-scanned beam used by Connexant to shoot the mask. This will affect the price. 
_Chrome Side Down Reading_ : “Right” is usually correct. This specifies that when the Chrome is facing down, all features will appear as in the GDS file. Also that the text will be readable when looking at the plate with chrome down (away from user). 
_Polarity_ : “Clear” for a positive pattern (i.e. GDS objects will be chrome and block light) “Dark” for the opposite polarity. 
**To Do:** please check that this is correct, sounds opposite  
---  
_CD_ : Size of critical dimension in microns. They will print a test structure of this size to automatically measure to see if the print is within spec. Choose any size for this, usually the smallest feature size on the reticle. 
_Overlay Registration to grid_ : See price list. This sets the guaranteed precision of one mask level feature relative to another. 
_Pellicle Req’d_ : “No” is the correct answer. 
_Connexant PRMIS Lot No_ : Leave blank. 
_Special Instructions_ : _“Use tucsbgca.jb alignment marks for masks”, “See attached drawings for CD placement and specifications for each layer and for text information to include at the outside of each mask”_
5. The location of the critical dimension (CD) features, what they look like, and what the dimensions are should be included for each layer in which CDs are important. 
6. Also include any text that you want to be written at the outside of the usable mask area for each layer for your own purposes. For example, the mask name, layer name, Key Offset for Global Alignment in X and Y (i.e. One could ask for the text KOGX 25um to specify a key offset in X of 25um for global alignment, etc.), the key offset for local alignment in X and Y, and the repeat step distance in X and Y would be good to include on each layer. 
2) Alignment marks in exposure field, Global, Local (DFAS). To learn more about how these alignment marks work with the system, see the reticle handbook. In our system we mainly use manual global alignment to get +/- 0.25 or better alignment tolerance. Local alignment can be used but needs some characterization for each process. 
_Global alignment marks_ : These marks and how to place them on the mask are described on page 5-44 to 5-47 of the reticle handbook and are included as an attachment to this document. The difference of our system from the manual is that the objectives are 38.1 mm apart, not 76.2 mm as indicated in the manual. The distance of this mark (or marks) to the center of the cell in X and Y should be noted, this is the key offset and will be required when exposing a job. (Positive offset values are left for X and up for Y) 
_Local alignment marks_ : These marks and how to place them on the mask are described on page 5-33 to 5-34 of the reticle handbook and are included as an attachment to this document. If possible use one of each type if you desire to try to use local alignment. These can be light or dark field in nature. The distance of the center point of this mark (or marks) to the center of the cell in X and Y should be noted, this is the key offset and will be required when exposing a job. 
_3) Vernier Scales:_ These can be included to quantify the alignment offset after an exposure is done. The reticle handbook has an example of vernier scales on pages 5-49 to 5-53. You should include them for any layers that require critical alignment. 
_4) Resolution:_ If you have room in the mask layout, it is good to have features that can give the resolution of a given exposure. The resolution should show both “pillars” and “trenches” in the resist so that you can see whether the focus or exposure needs some tweaking for your particular process. 
**To Do:** delete the following section

**To Do:** ASML INSTRUCTIONS from WIKI:  
---  
### Vendor Instructions
  1. Use commercial mask/reticle houses: 
  2. Instruct vendor that this will be used on an **ASML 5500/300 system with 4x reduction**. They have all outer templates to make your mask match our system. You just provide them the data you want printed, at wafer-scale (1X), and they'll scale it up 4x and insert it into the template. 
    1. Academic users may use the UCSB-specific quotes we have negotiated for pricing. Industrial users will have to get their own pricing. 
      1. Email [Brian Thibeault](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Brian_Thibeault ""Brian Thibeault"") or [Demis D. John](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for info.
      2. Example Toppan Order Form via Digidat
  3. Reduction is 4X, instruct the mask makers to scale your CAD data to 4X size, which will determine price. Scale your mask critical dimensions (CD) and tolerances from the product quotes accordingly.
  4. Masks must be Quartz, 6"" x 6"" x 0.25” thick.


### Design Guidelines
  1. Layer-to-layer alignment marks are provided by a calibration mask in our system. No need to put alignment marks on your CAD file.
  2. Spacing between mask-plate fields : 1mm of Chrome between fields (at wafer scale) in order for the reticle masking blades to blank off unwanted areas.
  3. Field Sizes Available (at Wafer-Scale, 1x): 
    1. The full field useable exposure area is limited to the intersection of a 31mm diameter circle and a rectangle of dimensions 22mm x 27mm. See the schematic below for an illustration. Schematic of lens/aperture illumination. Fit a rectangle within this field to get the aforementioned rectangular field sizes.
    2. For High Resolution 0.63 NA: 21mm in X, 21mm in Y
    3. For 0.4 to 0.57 NA: 22mm in X, 22mm in Y
    4. Other rectangular sizes available, that fit within the lens/aperture intersection:

    5. In general, 250nm resolution will resolve over the entire field. Anything smaller than this may not resolve closer to the edges of the field where lens quality degrades, and will also have a smaller viable process window (tolerance of exposure/bake/develop parameters). A number of users have shot ~150nm features.


### Submission Details
When submitting the photo mask order, the following notes apply: 
  1. Although you will submit your CAD file at 1x wafer scale, the actual reticle is printed 4x larger. Make sure to choose your reticle grade accounting for this; eg. If I want to shoot 1.0µm lines, I should choose a photomask grade better/equal to 4.0µm.
  2. “GDS Level” is also knows as “layer number”
  3. Barcode text for the plate must be 12 characters or less. Avoid special characters, a-z/0-9 only. This text is what you type into the job program.
  4. “Min. Feature on Mask” refers to minimum clear or chrome feature, assuming features similar to lines/spaces.
  5. “Min. Contact” refers to features with aspect ratio close to 1:1, eg. Squares and circles. These have a separate spec due to the manufacturing process, so make sure to choose the appropriate grade of photomask with this in mind.
  6. Choose a Critcal Dimension “CD” similar to your most critical feature (scaled to the 4x reticle scale), so they will print & measure & guarantee test structures at that size.
  7. For UCSB purchases: you will need to submit your order in [UCSB Procurement Gateway](https://gateway.procurement.ucsb.edu) _**first**_ (as a ""_Non-Catalogue Item_ ""), with the cost estimate from our negotiated quote, so that you can get the Purchase Order (PO) Number (usually in the same day). Then submit the order form to the photomask vendor with this PO number entered on their order form.

General Information about system 
The stepper system is used to shoot a repeating pattern over wafer. It is primarily needed for jobs where feature resolution and/or alignment is critical. The contact aligners can be used for many jobs. There is a sign-up sheet on the web for the stepper and you must look at the tool status before signing up for time on this equipment. Please plan your time out as this system can get heavily used. 
Also, this system is very expensive and replacement parts, especially the optical column, are also expensive. Please be careful, slow, and meticulous when operating this piece of equipment. Many students rely on this piece of equipment for their research. 
1) System: GCA 6300 5x reduction i-line step and repeat, λ = 365 nm 2) Lens system mirrors both X and Y from mask to stepper 3) I-line intensity is ~180 mW/cm2 at the wafer 4) Lens: Olympus 2142: 21mm field on wafer, NA = 0.42, Depth of field = 1.2μm 5) Maximum die size ~(14.8 x14.8)mm2 6) Resolution: 0.7 um reproducible, 0.5 um achievable R&D 7) Registration tolerance: Max 0.30μm global alignment, Max 0.15μm local alignment (with care, you can achieve < 0.10 μm registration) 8) Minimum substrate size: ~ (15 x 15)mm2 (I have seen smaller substrates used in stepper , but they were mounted on a carrier wafer) 9) Maximum substrate size: ~ 4 inch wafer (round) , 6 inch wafer ( using custom paddles) 10) The baseline system focus and registration is checked weekly 
  

The system will be down from the following lab conditions: 1) Power Outage. For outages of 1 hour or less, system will be back on line in 2 hours. Four outages more than 1 hour, system will be back on after 8 hours so that mechanical system restabilizes to the environmental chamber. 2) Cooling Water Outage. Environmental unit goes down. For outages of 1 hour or less, system will be back on line in 2 hours. Four outages more than 1 hour, system will be back on after 8 hours so that mechanical system restabilizes to the environmental chamber. 3) Compressed Air Outage. The vibration isolation table will not be operational. System back on line as soon as table legs refill with air. 
This document should answer most questions and prepare you for most operations necessary to achieve good results on the stepper. Manuals are available for more detailed descriptions of the stepper operation. 
Aligning reticle (mask) to system 
The alignment of the mask to the system is critical for achieving reproducible alignment. System alignment marks on the reticle are located near the right and left edges of the mask and are 103 mm apart so they do not get exposed within the 100 mm exposure area of the mask. These marks are put on automatically by Photronix and the gds file can be obtained from Brian Thibeault if you use a different vendor. Use the following procedure to align the mask correctly to the system. 
1) Unlock spindle and swing lamp column to middle position so that the lens is exposed. 2) Place mask chrome side down so that wording appears correct ( as seen in L-edit file). 3) Swing lamp column so that objective can be used to align mask, DO NOT tighten spindle lock at this time. 4) Using your hands and looking through microscope, shift and rotate mask so that the “crosses” are roughly aligned 5) Tighten spindle lock. This releases a vacuum holder onto the top of the mask so that the mask may be precisely aligned. 6) Looking through microscope, use alignment knobs to translate and rotate the mask into position. First focus the objective by using the knob on top of the microscope. Use the right alignment mark for the x-axis alignment and both alignment marks for the y-axis and rotation alignments. NOTE: to get best and fastest results approach alignment from one direction (do not try to wiggle back and forth about the alignment position. Backlash in the mechanics can make this frustrating). You should see equal amounts of light in between all lines when the mask is aligned well (within 0.1 um). 7) Once mask is aligned, pull the reticle vacuum button to the left of the lens column. 8) Use the stencil (usually L-shape mask cover), to cover part of the mask plate that you do NOT want to be exposed. If you have just one layer on your mask plate, you do not need to use the stensil. There are also blade aperatures that could be used. The knobs on the lamp column X,Y) can be adjusted to 100,75,50 and 25% to be open. Fully open blade aperatures would be at 100% 9) You are now ready to proceed with a focus job, map job, or exposure job. 10) This part is important. If alignments are critical, do not just brush through this procedure. The global alignment requires good, precise alignment of the reticle with the system in order to work correctly. The local alignment system can adjust for local X and Y misalignment, but not rotational errors. 
Logging into computer/checking the system 
The system administrator will set up a directory for you to log in and use the stepper at the time of training. Before using the system, you will need to log in and perform an interferometer zeroing routine. 
1) Check to make sure air table pressure is 60-80 psi. 2) Check to make sure vacuum is >20” Hg 3) At the colon log into the administrator account using LOG IN [10,1] 4) Type MODE and check for proper chuck size and system focus. Use 100 for 4” wafers and use 3 for everything else. DO NOT change any other parameters in here, except the chuck size. 5) Log out using LOG OUT 6) At the colon sign type LOG IN [10,xxx] and hit enter ( xxx-your account number) 7) Type ORIG and hit enter. This resets the laser interferometer position measurement system and moves the stages through its entire motion. 
Setting up / editing an exposure job (Section 5 of Instruction Manual) 
Setting up the job: 
This section describes how to set up a job to do a step and repeat exposure of your patterns. A more detailed description is given in section 5 of the instruction manual. Jobs are created using the SPEC command. First information about the array steps, alignment offsets, and general job is asked for. Passes are attached to each job to apply parameters unique to each pass specified. In this way all exposure information for a complete mask set can be specified all in one job. Following is the procedure for setting up a job and passes. Notes: If at any point you wish to stop and start over with the job description hit CTRL C followed by A and ENTER on the keyboard to abort the SPEC command. An abort of this type will result in no saved information. Also when a * is displayed, this indicates the default value if you hit enter for a reply to a question asked by the computer in setting up or editing any job. If a numeric value is asked for hitting enter will leave the value previously specified, if that exists. Also, if you put in an incorrect value and wish to go back a step type “?” and ENTER. 
1) At the colon sign type SPEC “filename” and hit enter. The filename can be 1 to 9 alphanumeric characters long. 2) Select metric units 3) Input a job comment such as “HBT-1 process” 4) Set tolerance to 1 (default value is 3). Please use 1-the time required to stop and settle the stage to tolerable degree of vibration. 5) Scale corrections will only be needed if wafer shrinkage or expansion has occurred in a previous process step. Hitting enter without entering a value here results in 0 being used. This is the normal answer. 6) Hit enter for orthogonality with no value. 7) Enter the wafer diameter in mm. This defines the maximum area in which exposure can occur. If you have a square or non circular piece, you will need to specify a diameter that includes the entire square, not the length of a square. 8) Enter the step size in X in mm at the wafer plane 9) Use “C” for specifying the number of columns to expose, “S” for spanning a certain width in the X direction, and A to fill in all area in X direction to the edge of a circular wafer. For square pieces you will always use “C”. For full wafers, you may use any of these options depending on the process. For quarter wafers, you will most likely use “C” and make the job array look square. You will then use dropouts in each pass to specify more complicated array shapes. 10) When “C” is entered, you will then be able to enter the number of columns desired. 11) Repeat 8 through 10 for the Y step. The final array is centered on the wafer. 12) Translate Origin is generally used only if the wafer is off-center. 13) If you wish to see an “*” cartoon of the exposure array hit Y for display, otherwise hit Enter. 14) Layout will give you a display of the nuber of rows and columns and the distance from die 1,1 to the array center, taking origin translation into account.. Ususally this is not looked at. Hit enter to pass this up. 15) If you wish to adjust the numbers of rows and columns you can do this at the Adjust prompt. Usually, you can hit enter to skip this. 16) Standard Keys. If this is used, then the die used for right and left alignment is chosen automatically by the system. This is good if you have a wafer larger than 38.1 mm in the X direction and both alignment marks are exactly 38.1 mm apart and have the same offset from the die center. If you do not meet these conditions, you will need to choose N. 17) If “N” is chosen you will need to enter the row and column of the alignment die. 18) Right Key Offset. The distance from the die(mask) center to the alignment mark center for the alignment mark die. Enter the number in mm at the wafer plane. See picture below for sign convention of alignment key offsets. 
19) If non-standard alignment keys are selected, you will need the Left Key Offset as well. 20) Skip through epi shift. 21) Now you are ready to enter information specific to passes. 22) Enter the name of the first pass. When you expose a job, you will specify it as filename\pass. The name of a pass can be 1 to 9 alphanumeric characters long. (i.e. emitter) 23) Next enter a pass comment 24) Next, input an exposure time between 0 and 128 sec. The calibrations are done at 1.2 sec. Since the lamp power is held constant, your times should not change over time. This time should be optimized for your substrate and process before doing the real devices to ensure optimum resolution. 25) Based on a focus calibration that you do, you will have a focus offset from the baseling calibration job. The current baseline focus setting is posted on the machine, so you should enter the correct focus setting for your job based on the current calibration. 26) Enter Y or N for local alignment 27) Select G for the Revert to command, the P option does not work. 28) Enter 1 for number of sites per DXD alignment if you will be using the local alignment, this will align every die. 29) For Die Alignment Offset, the offset of the DFAS center to the die center at the wafer plane is entered for X and Y. You should run a test sample to determine how well the DFAS system is performing for your mask set and process. You may need a small offset in X or Y to compensate. 30) Use pass shift to shift all exposures in this pass by a set amount. Usually this option is passed over, but may be used if you have multiple levels on a single mask and are aperturing all layers but the one of interest and this pattern is off-center. You would enter the correct offset to ensure pattern alignment. See picture below for sign convention for X and Y for pass shifts to place pattern into center of wafer. 
  

31) Array or Plug. When P is entered, only those row and column sites that the user enters will be exposed. When A is entered all sites previously specified will be exposed except dropouts specified later. 32) When P is entered, enter the row and column numbers of die you wish to be exposed. Enter D at the R prompt to display the currently selected die. Press return with a blank entry at the R prompt when finished. 33) In the dropouts section, sites or entire rows or columns can be removed from the exposure. Enter the row. Then enter at the C prompt : nothing to remove the whole row, the first and last column number with a dash in between (i.e.3-6) to remove several sits, or a single number to remove a single site. Enter D at the R prompt to view the die that will be exposed. Enter V at the R prompt to see a list of dropouts. Enter ? at the R prompt to put back in the last die that was dropped out. Again hit return with no entry at the R prompt to exit. 34) Answer Y to save pass. 35) If no other passes are desired, hit enter with no entry at the name prompt. 36) Enter another pass name if desired and hit enter. 37) If the pass information is mostly the same as a previous pass, hit Y at the Copy prompt and enter the name of the pass to be copied, then change any needed parameters after the job is saved using the EDIT command. 38) Say Y to Write to Disk or all information will be lost. 39) You are ready. 
Editing an existing job: 
To edit an existing job, use the EDIT command followed by the file name. You can then scroll through job and all passes and change any desired parameters. Don’t forget to save the changes. If you just wanted to look at the program you can use the EDIT command and then use CTRL C followed by A and a carriage return to abort the command and not save any changes. 
Loading a wafer into the system 
Before loading a wafer, after putting on the resist, make sure that there is no resist on the backside of the wafer. This can cause errors in the interpreted best focus point since the wafer surface may be at a different height. 
1) Attach the appropriate chuck to the system. 2) Place your wafer centered on the chuck, noting the orientation. If you are doing an alignment step, make sure to place the wafer in the same orientation and as best as possible in the same location as the first exposure. The set screws in the chuck can help to get reproducible placement of the wafer. When the wafer is in place, flip the right vacuum switch upwards to hold the sample. 3) Place the sample chuck onto the stage, again trying to be repeatable, and flip the left vacuum switch upwards to hold the chuck. 4) Now you are ready to do an exposure. 
Focus / Exposure optimization (End of Section 5 of Instruction Manual) 
The system is calibrated weekly on 2 inch Si wafers with the 2” wafer chuck. Your substrate type/thickness/resist may require different focus and exposure settings that the standard calibration. A focus / exposure optimization should be done to tweak your process relative to the calibration baseline. To do this you can use one of your already defined jobs and passes and your highest resolution mask. The command EXPO will shoot a specified serpentine array based on the parameters in your job\pass. The focus and/or exposure can be varied across this array to determine the optimum focus relative to the baseline. One focus step is equal to 0.1 um of focus depth. 
1) Before doing an expo job, use the “MODE” command to check that the system focus is set as recorded in the baseline sheet attached to the machine. Do not change any other values using this command. 2) Use the command EXPO jobname\passname and hit enter 3) Enter starting row within array specified in the pass 4) Enter ending row within the array specified in the pass 5) Enter starting column within array specified in the pass 6) Enter ending column within the array specified in the pass 7) Enter F to vary the focus in a serpentine pattern, E to vary the exposure in a serpentine pattern, or R to increment focus for each row and exposure for each column within the array. 8) Enter the parameters as prompted by the computer. They will differ based on which option is chosen. 9) Press RESET on the small keyboard next to the monitor 10) Press the MAN and S/C simultaneously 11) Wait a few seconds and press MAN again and the wafer will move underneath the two objectives used for global alignment. 12) Since alignment is not needed for a calibration like this, press the EXP key on the small keyboard to shoot the array. The PC next to the stapper will display a cartoon showing each die as it is exposed. 13) When done, do the development according to the process and inspect in the microscope. 14) The computer will ask you for the best row and column. 15) The computer will then tell you the focus and exposure based on the row and column you input. 16) Do not update system focus ! Input a focus offset into your own exposure job. (If you update the focus, you must change it back using the MODE command when you are done) 
Performing an exposure job 
1) Before doing an expo job, use the “MODE” command to check that the system focus is set as recorded in the baseline sheet attached to the machine. Do not change any other values using this command. 2) Type EXEC jobname\passname and hit enter. (See “Wafer alignment to mask / Local Alignment (DFAS)” below for local alignment job syntax) 3) Type in the desired exposure time. 4) Type in desired focus offset. 5) Press RESET on the small keyboard. 6) Press MAN and S/C simultaneously. 7) Wait about 5-10 seconds. 8) Press MAN. 9) Sample will move to alignment position/do global alignment. 
Wafer alignment to mask / Local Alignment (DFAS) : The best way to use this is to use a mapping routine followed by a shoot using the corrections given by the map. A mapping routine should be set-up in your job with a pass name named mapxx. Make sure you specify die x die is to be used and that you have the correct key offsets for the global and local alignment marks. The command you will then use is: MAP jobname\mapxx,jobname\passname. The first exposure is the mapping pass. When asked to make corrections, say yes. The exposure job will then be performed. 
  
Wafer alignment to system / Global (Manual Operation Only) The joysticks and focus knobs are used in this part of the exposure sequence to align the wafer to the system. The sequence of operations you do will depend on whether or not you used standard alignment keys or not. If you placed the sample close to the position you did during the first exposure, you should see an alignment mark in the right side of the screen. If not, you will need to find this mark using the position joystick by following a spiraling outward from the initial position. Pressing “F” repeatedly on the keyboard will do this spiral finding for you automatically. The joysticks have a double speed. Press joystick far for the high speed, shallow for the low speed. To change the joystick speed hit O on the main keyboard. Once the alignment mark is found follow one of the following procedures. 
Standard Alignment Keys: a) Adjust the focus knob to get a crisp image. b) Align the right mark using the position joystick. c) Use the Theta joystick to rotate the left image into position. Positive Theta = clockwise rotation of chuck. If you run out of theta alignment, you will need to adjust your sample on the chuck. d) The left image is used for theta only. e) Repeat process until satisfied with the alignment. You can obtain better than 0.2 um alignment consistently if you are careful with reticle and global alignment. 
Non-Standard Alignment Keys: a) Adjust the focus knob to get a crisp image. b) Align the right mark using the position joystick. c) Press A on the main keyboard to toggle to the left alignment mark. d) Use the Theta joystick to rotate the left image into position. Positive Theta = clockwise rotation of chuck. If you run out of theta alignment, you will need to adjust your sample on the chuck. e) The left image is used for theta only. f) Press A again to move to the right alignment mark g) Again adjust the right alignment mark h) Repeat process until position and theta are acceptable. 
9) After global alignment, press EXP on small keyboard and the job will be executed. 10) Remove the sample from the stage when done. 11) Develop resist and inspect in microscope for alignment (if needed) 12) Computer may ask for next wafer. To escape out of this press CTRL C followed by A and the enter key to abort out of the loop. If you have another wafer with the same job\pass, you can do it now without aborting.

Troubleshooting. 
What to do in case of computer (monitor) freeze-up. Please try these things in this order. 
1) Try CTRL C followed by A and Enter. This will abort any command that may have hung up. 2) Press RESET on small monitor keyboard. 3) Follow this sequence: a) Pull out upper keyboard. b) Hit “Scroll Lock” button twice followed by the number 2. This switches the upper monitor from the smart-set computer to the PC control computer. Try a second time if this doesn’t work. You should see a black screen with “Ready” near the top or you will see a menu driven screen. If the monitor switching does not work, go up to the gray interfce box on top of the stepper control rack. Press the gray flash button. This is located in the area where the cables all plug in. c) Push in upper keyboard. d) Lift up plastic flap over lower keyboard and press break e) Turn off lower monitor by pulling out the monitor box and using the switch on the top right front corner of the box (DO NOT TURN OFF SYSTEM POWER SWITCH ON MONITOR! This will shut down the whole system) f) Wait 1 minute and turn the monitor back on. g) Let monitor warm up until you see a cursor on the screen. h) Hit the Set Up key on the stepper keyboard (lower keyboard) i) Hit Line/Local key (number 4) so that the on-line LED lights. j) Hit the Set Up key again. You should have a cursor on the screen. k) Pull out upper keyboard and press the Alt button and “O” at the same time. l) Hit Return to start the program. m) Push in upper keyboard. n) At the prompt on the lower monitor, enter the time and date as specified (10:25 19-NOV-02) o) Stepper will finish booting up. p) Pull out upper keyboard and hit “Scroll Lock” button twice followed by the number 1 to transfer monitor back to the smart-set computer. Try a couple times if this does not work and use the flash button (see instruction b) if needed. q) You are ready to Log In. 4) Follow this sequence: a) Follow system shut down sequence, but DO NOT TURN OFF LAMP OR ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT b) Wait 5 minutes. c) Follow system start-up sequence except for instructions on lamp or environmental unit. 
What to do if the local alignment or wafer exposure mapping hangs up on the upper monitor. 1) Reset lower Advent computer and wait for reboot. 
What to do in case of unplanned power outage. 1) CR Staff will take care of the system in the morning. 
What to do for alignment error. 
1) Verify that correct alignment key offset is being used 2) Verify that the mask is aligned 3) Verify that the baseline is correct (check values in MODE against the last calibration in the calibration notebook) 4) If you have DFAS alignment marks, perform a MAP job to verify alignment. 
What to do for focus resolution problems. 
1) Verify system focus using the MODE command 2) Perform a focus (EXPO) job using the same type of wafer that you will use for your real job and use the optimal focus offset determined from this job. You may need to look at both exposure time and focus. 3) Verify that your wafer is not bowed (i.e. under stress from some process) 
What to do in case of mask vacuum problem. 
1) Check that small pump is running in back of system. 
```
Make sure vacuum level is above 20” Hg.
         2)   Push foot down onto mask with hand so that the vacuum holds the mask.

```

What to do in case of focus getting stuck and system hanging up. 
1) Adjust manual focus knob so that a negative number appears on volt meter. 2) Note die on computer screen at right of system. Abort using Ctrl-C followed by A, edit the program and drop out the problem die. If you have exposed some die already, you may want to drop them out too for the second run. 
What to do in case of the stage limit going too far (red stage limit light will be lit inside the stepper chamber next to the joystick. 
1) Press the lit limit switch to release the stage. 
Contacts to call if you cannot undo the problem. Do not call after 10 p.m. unless there is a real emergency (A deadline for a paper or conference is not a real emergency)

Ask for Matt or Robert. 480-892-4433. 3) If neither can be reached, leave a note on the stepper and the white board that the stepper is down. E-mail Brian Thibeault at thibeault@ece.ucsb.edu to report the problem. 
  

Mask Layout / Alignment Marks / Ordering from Photronics / Specifications 
5) Mask specifications to Photronics using old Connexant order form The following material should be sent to them to do a job: 
2. Mask file in GDSII format by ftp. Site: “dragon.photronics.com or 207.77.140.1”, User Name: ucsbsd@199.36.4.16 Password: university. 3. The mask file should be the same scale size as will appear on the mask. The features on the wafer will be 5 x smaller. L-Edit has a feature to scale dimensions so that the original mask file can be made with the correct on-wafer dimensions and then the job can be scaled and saved as a separate file. Each layer in the document must have a unique GDSII number assigned to it. These numbers are used by Photrinics. 4. You must send a purchase order and put a part number on the order form. The part number is anything you make up and will appear on the mask. 5. You need to fill out a Connexant Photomask Order form (2 pages). Most fields you will fill in are obvious. Here are the meanings of the not-so-obvious ones. Media Type : “ftp” is the answer for electronically sent data. Data Scale : “1 x” is the correct answer if the mask layout dimensions sent are those that will be on the mask (remember that the system will shrink these dimensions by 5 times on the wafer) Material : Quartz Material Size: 5” x 5” x .09” C.D. Feature Type: “rectangle” is usually the correct answer Data Extents Xlow, Ylow, Xhigh, and Yhigh: In the L-edit mask file, these are the box coordinates, in microns from the origin, of a box that just contains all of the features in the mask. Reticle/Mask Level I.D: The name of the level Topcell Structure Name: The cell in the L-edit file that contains the features data for the mask. Add. Unit: This is the address unit size of the beam used by Connexant to shoot the mask. This will affect the price. Chrome Side Down Reading: “Right” is usually correct. This specifies that if the Chrome is facing down, all features will appear as in the mask file. Also that the text will be readable. Polarity: “Clear” for a positive pattern (i.e. objects will be in chrome and block light) “Dark” for the opposite polarity. CD: Size of critical dimension in microns Overlay Registration to grid: See price list. This sets the guaranteed precision of one mask level feature relative to another. Pellicle Req’d: “No” is the correct answer. Connexant PRMIS Lot No: Leave blank. Special Instructions: “Use tucsbgca.jb alignment marks for masks”, “See attached drawings for CD placement and specifications for each layer and for text information to include at the outside of each mask” 6. The location of the critical dimension (CD) features, what they look like, and what the dimensions are should be included for each layer in which CDs are important. 7. Also include any text that you want to be written at the outside of the usable mask area for each layer for your own purposes. For example, the mask name, layer name, Key Offset for Global Alignment in X and Y (i.e. One could ask for the text KOGX 25um to specify a key offset in X of 25um for global alignment, etc.), the key offset for local alignment in X and Y, and the repeat step distance in X and Y would be good to include on each layer. 
6) Alignment marks in exposure field, Global, Local (DFAS). To learn more about how these alignment marks work with the system, see the reticle handbook. In our system we mainly use manual global alignment to get +/- 0.25 or better alignment tolerance. Local alignment can be used but needs some characterization for each process. 
Global alignment marks: These marks and how to place them on the mask are described on page 5-44 to 5-47 of the reticle handbook and are included as an attachment to this document. The difference of our system from the manual is that the objectives are 38.1 mm apart, not 76.2 mm as indicated in the manual. The distance of this mark (or marks) to the center of the cell in X and Y should be noted, this is the key offset and will be required when exposing a job. (Positive offset values are left for X and up for Y) 
Local alignment marks: These marks and how to place them on the mask are described on page 5-33 to 5-34 of the reticle handbook and are included as an attachment to this document. If possible use one of each type if you desire to try to use local alignment. These can be light or dark field in nature. The distance of the center point of this mark (or marks) to the center of the cell in X and Y should be noted, this is the key offset and will be required when exposing a job. 
7) Vernier Scales: These can be included to quantify the alignment offset after an exposure is done. The reticle handbook has an example of vernier scales on pages 5-49 to 5-53. You should include them for any layers that require critical alignment. 
8) Resolution: If you have room in the mask layout, it is good to have features that can give the resolution of a given exposure. The resolution should show both “pillars” and “trenches” in the resist so that you can see whether the focus or exposure needs some tweaking for your particular process.

Use this camera with various mounts, to record training videos for your tools. It records spoken audio very well, automatically canceling much of the background noise. 
You can edit the videos after the fact, but it's not required - a ""good enough"" video even with mistakes or corrections would be fine. 
We recommend doing online Zoom trainings, during which you screenshare and pull up the recorded video(s), which allows you to play/pause/zoom in on certain parts of the video as needed, and pause to answer user questions.

      1. Pick up your camera: 
         * Power on your camera.
         * Open the utility drawer by swiping from the top to the bottom of the touch display, then select ""Preferences.""
         * Select ""Connections"" and then tap on ""Connect Device.""
         * _Optional_ : At this point, you can tap on the ""i"" icon i
      2. Open the GoPro App on your SmartPhone: 
         * Select the Camera logo at the bottom left corner of the app and it will automatically begin scanning for your camera
         * You should see ""We Found Your GoPro"" and a blue ""**Connect** "" button. Tap on **Connect**. 
           * _Optional_ : You will see a section to change your camera's name, or you can tap on the bottom button to leave the name as it is.
         * Once a name is set your GoPro App will show a live preview of your camera. You're all set!
  * Wear headphones for your smartphone (wireless is great, but wired is also ok). 
    * This helps with checking to see if a video sounds/looks ok.
  * Put the GoPro on your head mount, and launch the GoPro phone app and ""_**enable live preview**_ "". 
    * _Detailed Instructions for Live Preview are below._
  * Adjust the angle of the camera so the preview shows what you’re looking at. You want to be ""naturally"" looking at something, and make sure the GoPro shows the same thing. 
    * Usually the headmount will aim _high_ - looking above what your eyes are looking at, so adjust it to point down, typically ~30-40° downwards.


### In the Lab: Recording your video
  * _(optional) Bring wired or bluetooth headphones that you can use with your smartphone - this is only for listening to video while in the lab. The ""live"" audio will be from the GoPro's built-in Mic - it works fine in the lab._
  * Turn on camera - hold down the power button on the side.
  * Place camera on mount - either head mount (use your own assigned head mount), or Clip mount etc.
  * On GoPro smartphone app: 
    * Enable Live Preview to view the video from the SmartPhone App.

  * Adjust camera angle using Live Preview on smartphone: 
    * Look naturally at some object, and make sure the SmartPhone's preview is showing the same object centered in the screen.
    * Typically the camera is angled **too high** by ~30-40°.
    * Adjust the camera's angle on the your mount, so that what you look at is centered on the screen, then tighten. (Same as done outside the lab.)
  * Start/stop the video recording with the Circle button on the SmartPhone app.

  * You can always stop the recording and restart, with the intention of piecing the recording together at the end. However, it is much less effort to only do a single take and fix mistakes during the recording, as you can spend a lot of time on video editing.


  * You can look at saved videos through the smartphone app, to check your recording, in the **My Media** section of the GoPro App. It may require you to download the video to your smartphone, which can take a while. Sometimes it shows a lower-quality version just to avoid downloading - don't worry, the ""full"" version will usually look and sound much better. 
    * This is where **headphones** in the lab are very helpful, so you can hear the audio of your recordings.


## Saving the Video to your computer
There are two ways to save the video. I prefer to plug the GoPro into a laptop/desktop computer (good for posting to Wiki and online trainings via web-meeting). You can also save it to your smartphone wirelessly, but this appears to be more complex for our purposes (good for social media). 
  1. Outside the lab, at your desktop/laptop computer:
  2. Plug the GoPro camera into your computer using the supplied USB-A to USB-C cable. 
    1. This is a high-data rate cable - cheaper versions are known to not work properly, so **don't lose this**!
  3. Turn on the GoPro Camera by holding down the power button on the Side.
  4. On a **Mac:** _(approximate instructions, not exact)_
    1. Launch **Applications / Image Capture.app**
    2. Select the GoPro camera in the sidebar - you will see all the recorded videos and photos.
    3. Choose a folder to Download into on the bottom of the screen
    4. Select the media to download (use Shift or ⌘ to select multiple items)
    5. Click ""Download Selected"" or ""Download All"" and wait for it to complete, it can take some time. 
      1. The files will be downloaded to the specified folder.
    6. Use the Delete button [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/1/1c/GoPro_HERO8_Black_Instructions_-_Mac_save_to_computer_2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:GoPro_HERO8_Black_Instructions_-_Mac_save_to_computer_2.png) to delete selected files from the GoPro memory card. You can select multiple files with the Shift or Command keys.
  5. On **Windows:** _(approximate instructions, not exact)_
    1. Open **My Computer > HERO8 BLACK**
    2. Copy the files from the HERO8 drive to the desired destination folder
    3. Delete files from the GoPro memory card with _Shift+Delete_ ([![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/0c/Forward_Delete_Button.png/30px-Forward_Delete_Button.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Forward_Delete_Button.png) aka. Forward-Delete)


## Editing Video
GoPro video is always split up into sections of about 15min each, automatically on the camera. This is not changeable on the Gopro. 
  * Use the free software 
  * Just drag your files into the timeline in order. You can use the Creation date of the files to figure out the correct order.
  * GoPro's File naming convention: 
    * The **first** digit is the number in the sequence
    * The **second/last** digit is the video recording number - this is counter-intuitive.
    * Example - The following sequence would be the _first video_ shot on the GoPro, in order: 
      * GH**001** 000 _1_.mp4
      * GH**002** 000 _1_.mp4
      * GH**003** 000 _1_.mp4
    * The Second video shot (_underlined_) would be the following files: 
      * GH001 _0002_.mp4
      * GH002 _0002_.mp4
      * GH003 _0002_.mp4
  * Export as :


  *     * Target: MP4
    * Profile: HD 720p: 30fps (1280x720)
    * Quality: High


This takes ~30min to stitch a ~1hr video. 
Now you have a single file of the GoPro recording.

To measure the contact angle of water on a surface, perform the following procedure. 
  * Note that the image through the scope is _inverted_ upside-down.
  * You will also see a reflection of the water droplet on your polished substrates, as illustrated here:

### Alternate Measurement Technique - Tilt Angle
An alternate, ""quick and dirty"" method for comparing hydrophobicity between surfaces is to drop an identical amount of water on each sample's surface, and tilt the sample until the drop rolls off - the tilt angle required can be compared. This technique is much more ""noisy"" than the goniometer, but can be done without highly specialized equipment.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

# About
The applications of this tool are mainly in MEMS-device fabrication areas (releasing a MEMS structure by etching a sacrificial SiO2 layer below) with the use of Al2O3, Al or some other metal as an etch mask at 45oC. The tool uses vapor HF (VHF), EtOH (Ethanol vapor is an Alcohol-based one, ionizing the HF and activating etching, influencing within wafer etch uniformity, and being most compatible with VHF), and N2 gases and can process small sample(s) (on a 8"" Si carrier wafer) up to an 8"" wafer. There are 5 standard etch recipes installed in the tool with the SiO2 etch rate from low to high. The SiO2 under etch rate is from ~10nm/min to ~350nm/min.

  * DC/Pulsed Power supply
  * Hotplate / Stirrer
  * Cables/electrodes
  * Chemistry hardware for suspending thermocouples, electrodes and samples in beakers.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

## About
### Holography Lithography
The interference lithography system (aka. Holography) at UCSB uses a 15mW, single-mode, 325 nm HeCd laser that is filtered and expanded by pinhole filters to produce the large area exposure beam. The system uses a simple mirror configuration with a fixed 90 degree angle between the mirror and sample. The entire mirror/sample assembly is rotated in 0.1 degree increments to change the grating pitch from ~ 200 nm to ~ 280 nm (35 to 55 degrees) over an ~ 2 cm x 2 cm exposure area. 
[XHRiC](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/3/33/XHRiC-Anti-Reflective-Coating.pdf) bottom anti-reflection coating (BARC) & [THMR-3600HP](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lithography_Recipes#Chemicals_Stocked_.2B_Datasheets ""Lithography Recipes"") imaging resist spin-coated to ~80 nm thickness is used for grating exposure. 2-D gratings can be formed by rotating the sample and doing multiple exposures. Total exposure times are controlled by a manual shutter and are generally several minutes in length. 
### Photoluminescence Measurement
A photoluminescence measurement setup is co-located on the optical table. Please see the page for the PL system for more info: 
  * [**Photoluminescence PL Setup (Custom)**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photoluminescence_PL_Setup_\(Custom\) ""Photoluminescence PL Setup \(Custom\)"")


## Detailed Specifications

Hummer SEM Sample Coater - Techniques to reduce charging in SEMs,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Hummer_SEM_Sample_Coater_-_Techniques_to_reduce_charging_in_SEMs,"Instructions for this tool: **[SEM Sample Coater (Hummer)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/SEM_Sample_Coater_\(Hummer\) ""SEM Sample Coater \(Hummer\)"")**
To reduce charging while SEM'ing your sample, you need to give electrons hitting your sample surface a conductive path to reach the grounded SEM stage. Thin layers <<1µm layers can still transmit some charge through then (the beam penetrates through the layer), but ≥1µm insulating layers (SiO2, Si3N4, Photoresist) will prevent electrical charge from dissipating. 
The most reliable method for providing this conductive path is as follows: 
  1. Cleave/mount your sample for imaging
  2. Mount the sample onto the SEM sample holder as you would for imaging. Do this right before your scheduled SEM timeslots. 
    1. If possible, place at least one conductive clip on the top surface to provide a path for charge to dissipate. This can help a lot with dissipating charge, when combined with AuPd coating.
    2. Optionally use conductive tape on the back side, but this is not completely necessary if using the clip + AuPd. It can help with mounting and keeping the sample stable while mounting the clips and during the next steps.
  3. Load sample into [**_the Hummer_**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/SEM_Sample_Coater_\(Hummer\) ""SEM Sample Coater \(Hummer\)"") by putting the SEM sample holder's post into a metal tin, so the sample is oriented similarly as it will be during SEM imaging. Users often punch a small hole in the tins to enable this for SEM holders with small posts.
  4. Run the Hummer coating according to the Hummer instructions, eg. 60sec is typical. 
    1. If sample is still charging in the SEM after this, you can always bring the sample back to the hummer for an additional 60sec.
    2. Too thick coating and your SEM image will show a grainy AuPd coating on the sample., and lose imaging contrast between materials.
  5. Keep the sample mounted in this orientation, with clip attached - you now have a thin coating on the surface that connects the sample surface → the clip, and thus → electrically-grounded stage. Don't remove the sample or the clip, or you may break/reduce the conductive coating between sample and clip/sample holder. 
    1. Removing the sample can increase charging slightly, but the sample will still have a conductive AuPd coating applied either way.


The AuPd coating might remove with Gold etchant, as reported by lab users.

IBD: Calibrating Optical Thickness,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/IBD:_Calibrating_Optical_Thickness,"Basic method for calibrating optical thickness, for 
  * Get dep rate & refractive index (RIX) of individual SiO and TaO films, using single-deps and [J.A. Woolam Ellipsometer](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ellipsometer_\(Woollam\) ""Ellipsometer \(Woollam\)"") or equivalent tool. Approx. rate from previous user is also acceptable.

    
  * Get RIX at the target wavelength, using ""Derived Params"" on JAW or Cauchy equation A/B/C params. For example, if targeting a DBR centered at 1550nm (target λ=1550nm), you will want to know the RIX at 1550nm specifically.


  * Calculate approximate dep. time to achieve a 1/4-wave thickness at the target wavelength, for each film (SiO and TaO).

    
  * For example, if the dep. rate of SiO2 measured at 5.2nm/min and RIX is n1550 = 1.494, then

             _SiO 1/4λ thickness: d 1/4λ = 1550nm / 4 / 1.494 = 259.4nm_     _**SiO 1/4λ time** : t1/4λ = 259.4nm ÷ 5.2nm/min = 49.88min = **2993.077 sec**_     (and then do the same for TaO)
  * Deposit a fabry-perot 1/2-λ of one film (SiO or TaO) cavity onto a Silicon piece, using the above 1/4-λ deposition _times_ (aka. ""SiO/4"" or ""TaO/4"" in the following), to calibrate that film's optical-thickness.

    
  * eg. for SiO Fabry-Perot cavity (aka. SiO-FP):

             _SiO/4 + TaO/4 + SiO/4 + TaO/4 + SiO/4 + TaO/4 +_(**SiO/4 + SiO/4**)_ + TaO/4 + SiO/4 + TaO/4 + SiO/4 + TaO/4_
  * Here we used only 3 periods of DBR on either side of the 1/2-λ cavity, to speed up the deposition.


  * Measure the reflectivity on [Filmetrics F10-RT](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Optical_Film_Spectra_%2B_Optical_Properties_\(Filmetrics_F10-RT-UVX\) ""Optical Film Spectra + Optical Properties \(Filmetrics F10-RT-UVX\)"").
  * Locate the wavelength of the minimum (dip) in the optical spectrum. Spectrum will typically be very broad, due to omitting many of the surrounding DBR layers for speed.

    
  * For example, the trough might show a minimum at 1600nm instead of the targeted 1550nm.


  * Correct the film's optical thickness as so:

              t1/4λ * λtarget / λmeasured = _corrected_ t1/4λ     2993.077 sec * (1550nm / 1600nm) = **2899.543 sec** for SiO/4 layers
  * Use this corrected time for all SiO/4 layers.
  * You only need to edit the One ""SiO2_dep"" step in the IBD recipe, which will also change all ""SiO2_dep"" steps in the recipe.


  * Here is an example of a Fabry-Perot cavity that was targeting a 1050nm center-wavelength, but measured a 1100nm trough:[![Simulated plot of SiO-FP reflectivity, for a 1050nm target but measured trough at 1100nm](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/a/ae/IBD_SiO-FP_-_long_1100nm_-_Reflectivity_Spectrum_%28EMpy%29.png/300px-IBD_SiO-FP_-_long_1100nm_-_Reflectivity_Spectrum_%28EMpy%29.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:IBD_SiO-FP_-_long_1100nm_-_Reflectivity_Spectrum_\(EMpy\).png)Example: Targeting a 1050nm SiO-FP, the measured trough location is at 1100nm. In this case, one would apply a correction to the _SiO/4 time_ by multiplying by (_1050÷1100)_.


  * Do the same Fabry-Perot correction for the other film, in this case do an ""TaO-FP"", and apply the new TaO/4 time to the recipe.
  * Perform a test-DBR deposition onto Silicon, eg. 9 periods (less than full, which could be 15 periods or more), and measure on [Filmetrics F10-RT](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Optical_Film_Spectra_%2B_Optical_Properties_\(Filmetrics_F10-RT-UVX\) ""Optical Film Spectra + Optical Properties \(Filmetrics F10-RT-UVX\)""), to confirm that center wavelength is in the right spot. An example DBR test-dep targeting 1050nm looks like this:[![Example reflectivity spectra of the 9-period DBR test-dep, showing 1050nm center-wavelength in the middle of the DBR high-reflectivity spectrum.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/29/IBD_9-period_DBR_-_Reflectivity_Spectrum_%28EMpy%29.png/300px-IBD_9-period_DBR_-_Reflectivity_Spectrum_%28EMpy%29.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:IBD_9-period_DBR_-_Reflectivity_Spectrum_\(EMpy\).png)Example reflectivity spectra of the 9-period DBR test-dep.
  * Perform full-DBR deposition onto production parts. Include a flat Silicon witness for measuring the final DBR reflectivity spectrum.  



  * Sources of error: thick, stressy films exhibit the stress-optic effect, in which compressed films (closer to the substrate) will often show a reduction in RIX. In going from a 9-period DBR to a 18-period DBR, you might see a ~10-20nm blue-shift. Some users for whom such a shift is outside the device tolerance will do a full DBR dep, then apply a % reduction to all dep times to further dial in the DBR reflectivity band.
  * The same method can be used to calibrate optical-thickness for arbitrary multi-layer optical filters.


  
Note, you can verify/better understand the above method using any electromagnetic thin-film simulator. For example, [Demis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""). Demis created the above simulations using EMpy.

## About
This is a three-chamber tool for etching of a variety of materials. 
Chamber one ""Etch Chamber"" is configured as an ICP etching tool with 1000 W ICP power, 500 W RF substrate power, and RT - 80°C operation with back-side He cooling and an electrostatic chuck to maintain controlled surface temperatures during etching. 
This chamber has the following dedicated gas sources: Cl2, BCl3, and O2
The chamber also has the following gas sources, where two of the lines must be manually switched between the two options shown (gasses can't be used simultaneously): N2/He, CHF3/Ar and CF4 /SF6
The system can be used to etch a variety of materials from SiO2 to metals to compound semiconductors. The chamber is evacuated with a 2000 lpm Osaka Vacuum magnetically levitated turbo pump, and is load-locked for fast pump down. 
The in-situ laser monitor installed on the etch chamber allows for repeatable etches and endpoint detection via continuous optical monitoring of the wafer reflectivity in a user-determined location, through a porthole on the chamber. 
Chamber two, ""Ashing Chamber"" is a 2000 W ICP chamber configures for plasma ""ashing"" of photoresist and other materials such as BCB. The substrate is not biased for isotropic etching, and the chamber has CF4 and O2 for the gases. This is especially well-suited for omni-directional etching of photoresist/PR removal, or BCB etch-back. 
Chamber three ""Rinse Chamber"" is a DI rinsing chamber that is not used/offline. 
The system accepts 6” wafers with SEMI-std. flats. Users often mount smaller pieces to the wafers, usually with easily removable oil to improve uniform heat-sinking. 
In Automatic mode, multiple wafers can be run through automatically with the cassette-based system.

## Edge-Bead Removal (DSEiii)
Make sure to remove photoresist from edges of wafer, or PR may stick to the top-side wafer clamp and destroy your wafer during unload! 
  * [Edge Bead Removal via Photolithography](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ASML_DUV:_Edge_Bead_Removal_via_Photolithography ""ASML DUV: Edge Bead Removal via Photolithography""): use a custom metal mask to pattern the photoresist with a flood exposure. 
    * If you are etching fully through a wafer, remember that removal of edge-bead will cause full etching in the exposed areas. To prevent a wafer from falling into the machine after the etch, you can [mount to a carrier wafer using wax](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Packaging_Recipes#Wafer_Bonder_.28Logitech_WBS7.29 ""Packaging Recipes"").
  * [Manual PR Edge-Bead Removal](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photolithography_-_Manual_Edge-Bead_Removal_Techniques ""Photolithography - Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques"") - using swabs and EBR100. This is prone to error and easy to accidentally leave a blob of PR on the edge - so be extra careful to ensure NO PR is left on the edges!

    * **STD_Bosch_Si (⭐️Production)** - Developed 2024-10 
      * Old Recipe Name: ""_**Plasma-Therm Standard DSE**_ "" - lower EtchA, less tolerant
    * Standard 
      * Cycles between polymer deposition ""Dep"" / Polymer etch ""Etch A"" / Si etch ""Etch B"" steps. Step Times gives fine control.
      * To reduce roughening/grassing (""black silicon""), Increase ""_Etch A_ "" _t_ ime by ~50%. Alternatively, reduce ""_Dep_ "" step time by ~20%.
    * Patterns with different exposed/etched areas will have different ""optimal"" parameters.
    * This recipe has 2s Etch A time compared to ""_**Plasma-Therm Standard DSE**_ "" (which has 1.5s Etch A) below - this reduced the undercut of mask to ~1% of the etch depth and the effect of [aspect ratio on etch rate](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/a/a1/Cal_vs_Legacy_DSE.png). All other recipe parameters are the same.
    * Selectivity to Photoresist ~60.
    * Selectivity to SiO2 should be higher, not yet measured.
    * Selectivity to Al2O3 is extremely high, >9000. See below TSV process for processing tips with Al2O3 hardmask.
    * If you need to pattern all the way to the edge of the wafer, PR won't work because you have to remove the edge-bead of photoresist (see above). Instead use hardmask process (See ""Through Silicon Via"" etch below).
    * <1% center to edge variability in etch rate.
    * Larger open area → lower selectivity & lower etch rate.
    * Thick PR's approx ≥10µm tend to burn, avoid thick PR's. They also make edge-bead removal very difficult. Instead use an SiO2 hardmask or the Al2O3/SiO2 hardmask below.

### Through Silicon Via (TSV) etch (DSEiii)
Since the topside clamp requires the removal of photoresist on the outermost ~5-7mm of the wafer, this makes PR incompatible with through-silicon etching (as the outer edges would be etched-through, dropping the inner portion into the chamber). In addition, in practice we have found that thick PR often roughens and burns during long ~30-60min etches, making removal very difficult. 
Instead, we recommend the following process with Al2O3 hardmask: 
```
**NOTE**: We have recently found that the wax-mounting process process can leave wax on the wafer clamp, causing the next user's wafer to get stuck and fail transfer!  **_DO NOT RUN_** the wax-mounting process without discussing with staff first. _(Through-wafer process with no wax is still acceptable.)_ -- Demis[](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D.

Please consider our [publication policy](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Publications_acknowledging_the_Nanofab ""Frequently Asked Questions"") if you use/modify this process._  
Deposit 150nm Al2O3 on either: 
  * [Veeco Nexus IBD](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Sputtering_Recipes#Al2O3_deposition_.28IBD.29)
  * AJA Sputter [3](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Sputtering_Recipes#Materials_Table_.28Sputter_3.29)/[4](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Sputtering_Recipes#Al2O3_Deposition_.28Sputter_4.29)/[5](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Sputtering_Recipes#Materials_Table_.28Sputter_5.29) (Check which has Al target installed)

| May need to do dep. rate check beforehand.   
Deposit ~3nm SiO2, _in situ_ (same machine as above)  | This improves adhesion to photoresist and prevents developer attacking the Al2O3.   
Lithography - your preferred method. Needs approx. ≥500nm thick PR.  |   
Etch the [Al2O3 in Panasonic ICP 1/2](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=ICP_Etching_Recipes#Al2O3_Etching_.28Panasonic_2.29) | Use 50W version. Overetch by ~20%, will also etch through the thin SiO2 layer.   
Strip PR - either _[in situ](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=ICP_Etching_Recipes#Photoresist_Etch.2FStrip_.28Panasonic_2.29)_ , or via NMP 80°C soak followed by [PEii Technics ashing](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Oxygen_Plasma_System_Recipes#Ashers_.28Technics_PEII.29).  |  _In situ_ PR strip appears to give better + faster results.   
If pieces of the wafer are at risk of falling into the chamber, mount the product wafer to a carrier wafer: [Logitech Wax Mounting Recipe - Bulk Crystal Bond](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Logitech_WBS7_-_Procedure_for_Wax_Mounting_with_bulk_Crystalbond_Stick)   
If you are only etching small holes through the wafer (majority of wafer is intact), then wax-mounting is not necessary.  |  **CONTACT[STAFF](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"")** before attempting this step!   
Critical - Ensure no wax is present on either side or edge of wafer prior to DSE etching, or wafer may break in the DSE during robot unload!   
Use POLOS spinners with ACE/ISO to clean front and back of wafer. _**IMPORTANT**_ for wax-mounting, to ensure wax does not stick your wafer to the DSE clamp.  Observe _carefully_ for any wax protruding from between wafers - redo spin-clean as needed.  | Also make sure wax thickness is not too thick, of long etches could cause wax to seep out from between the wafers.   
DSEiii etch - reduce Dep step to eliminate grassing: 
  * Bosch Cycles: Dep: 1.2sec / Etch A: 1.5sec / Etch B: 2.0sec
  * Rate ≈ 4.25µm / min

| Can use Lasermonitor and/or Camera to observe when etch is fully through. Trenches may get black/rough, but then clear up when fully etched. 
  * Record Helium FLOW during recipe run, for next step (if He leaks).


  * Ok to remove wafer, observe/measure, and re-load for etching.


  * If see black grass and etch rate drops, may need to run an O2 plasma with [Technics PEii](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)"") few min to remove polymer, Increase EtchA step time (eg. by 50-100%) and then continue the etch.

  
If you did not wax-mount your wafer, the recipe will eventually fail for Helium Pressure/Flow out of compliance. This is because the cooling Helium leaks through the wafer when the openings get fully etched through. Once this happens, 
  * Leave your wafer in the chamber, then


  * Edit recipe to set Helium Cooling (first step only) to ""Flow Control Only"".
  * Set to typical flow of normal process from above (Something like ~6sccm? Not sure. Exact value is not critical)
  * Re-run the recipe with He on Flow-control only until etch is complete.

|   
Strip Al2O3/SiO2 either with Buffered HF, or same Pan1/2 dry etch as above. BHF: Eg. ~2min to fully remove SiO2 + Al2O3, with overetch.  | See etch BHF rates of the thin-films on [this table](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wet_Etching_Recipes#Table_of_Wet_Etching_Recipes ""Wet Etching Recipes"").   
IF wax-mounted - either 
  * dissolve in Acetone overnight (make sure to excess-fill enough and cover tightly with tinfoil so it doesn't dry up), complete with ACE/ISO rinse

OR 
  * place wafer on tinfoil-covered hotplate at 150°C, and slide product wafer off, then 
    * ACE/ISO clean (eg. POLOS) to remove wax.

  * **""SiVertHFv2"" (⭐️Production)**
    * 20mTorr, RF=18W, ICP=950W, C4F8/SF6/CF4=120/48/54sccm 
      * This recipe has 2x gas flow compared to ""_**SiVertHF**_ "" below - this reduced the loading effect (dependence on % etched area).
    * Selectivity Silicon:Photoresist ≈ 5
    * Etch Rates: Si ≈ 300-350 nm/min; SiO2 ≈ 30-35 nm/min
    * 89-90 degree etch angle, ie, vertical.
    * High selectivity to Al2O3 masks. 
      * For high aspect ratio Si etching, try [ALD](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Layer_Deposition_\(Oxford_FlexAL\) ""Atomic Layer Deposition \(Oxford FlexAL\)"") [Al2O3](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Layer_Deposition_Recipes#Al2O3_deposition_.28ALD_CHAMBER_3.29 ""Atomic Layer Deposition Recipes"") (~20-30nm) + [SiO2](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Atomic_Layer_Deposition_Recipes#SiO2_deposition_.28ALD_CHAMBER_3.29 ""Atomic Layer Deposition Recipes"") (2nm, for PR adhesion) hardmasks followed by [Pan2 Al2O3 etch](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=ICP_Etching_Recipes#Al2O3_Etching_.28Panasonic_2.29) (will go straight through the thin SiO2 without additional etch time). Works well for allowing thin PR's (eg. [DUV](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML\) ""Stepper 3 \(ASML\)"") or [EBL](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_Lithography_System_\(JEOL_JBX-6300FS\) ""E-Beam Lithography System \(JEOL JBX-6300FS\)"") PR's) to enable deep etches.

### Process Notes/Observations
  * Due to high selectivity against SiO2, it may be necessary to run a ~10sec 50W SiO2 etch (below) to remove native oxide on Si. This can be performed _in situ_ before the Si etch. It's possible this is actually an effect of photoresist open-area - we have conflicting results. 
    * If you see very low etch rates, try the above SiO2 etch, or try a short [PR/BARC etch](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ICP_Etching_Recipes#PR/BARC_Etch_\(Fluorine_ICP_Etcher\)).
  * We have observed that full-wafers with small open area in _photoresist masks_ might require a recalibration of the C4F8/SF6 ratio in order to prevent very low etch rates.

## About
This system is configured as an ICP etching tool with 1000 W ICP power, 600 W RF substrate power, and 30C - 200°C operation with back-side He to maintain controlled surface temperatures during etching. This chamber has Cl2, BCl3, Ar, N2, and O2 for gas sources and can be used to etch a variety of materials from compound semiconductors to metals. The high temperature etching is specifically useful for etching of high Indium containing compound semiconductors such as InP, where etch product volatility is an issue. High aspect ratio, smooth vertical wall, InP and related compound semiconductor (InGaAs, InAlAs, InGaAsP, etc.) etching is done in this system. The chamber is configured for 4"" wafers. Pieces are handled by using a silicone-based thermal heat sink compound. Both sapphire and silicon carrier wafers are available. Laser end-point monitoring is also included in the system. 
### Cluster Configuration
A Deposition and Etch chamber are both attached to the same loadlock, allowing etching and deposition without breaking vacuum. Each chamber can be scheduled separately on SignupMonkey.

# About
This system is configured as an ICP PECVD deposition tool with 1000 W ICP power, 600 W RF substrate power, and 100°C-350°C operation. This chamber has 100% SiD4, N2, O2, and Ar for gas sources. The high density PECVD produces a more dense, higher quality SiO2 and Si3N4, as compared with conventional PECVD. With the high density plasma, deposition of high quality films can be deposited as low as 100°C for processes requiring lower temperatures. Stress compensation for silicon nitride is characterized. Processes are available for Gap-filling with SiO2.

The Deposition chamber currently has **Deuterated Silane (SiD4)** installed - identical to the normal Silicon precursor SiH4, except that it significantly lowers optical absorption in the near-infrared. This gas is **expensive** and thus more applicable to optical applications than to general-purpose SiN films.

## About
  1. The InfraScope ""HotSpot"" software is a failure analysis/fault isolation tool for semiconductor failure analysis. The InfraScope detects thermal infrared photons emitted from hot areas on semiconductor circuits. Such hot spot sites often mark the location of a process fault or damaged location of a circuit, such as a short circuit.
  2. The ""Emmi"" software detects photons emitted from electron-hole recombination sites on semiconductor circuits. Such recombination sites often mark the location of a process fault or damaged location of a circuit. The NIR cameral operates at 400nm - 1,000nm wavelength.
  3. The ""Thermal Map"" software allows the user to perform temperature mapping of materials and devices. The user easily determines the exact temperature at any point by color or by simply positioning the mouse arrow over the desired point and reading the desired temperature. This technique saves literally hundreds of hours over non-infrared techniques and it doesn't damage or affect the part in any way.


## Capabilities
  * 6 inch heated chuck, default temp = 40°C
  * Micrometer probes
  * Dark box
  * Two Keithley DC power supplies (SMU's). 0-200VDC & 0-1100VDC. 
    * Users may bring their own power supplies as needed for their specific devices and material testing.
  * ≤ 2.7µm resolution in the MWIR.
  * Cameras & Microscope objectives: 
    * Visible: 1x Macro
    * Visible + Near Infrared: 2.5x, 5x, 20x, 50x
    * Mid-IR (MWIR): 2x, 5x, 15x
  * The MWIR camera (LN2 cooled InSb) nominally operates at 1um - 5um wavelength with filtering nominally from 2-4µm, although intentional light emission beyond the filtered range is commonly observed. 
    * Users working on Mid-Infrared photonics can use this to take microscope observations of sub-threshold MIR optical emission. **Do _not_ shine high power laser emission towards the camera!**

Thermal Emission mode measures an actual temeperature, whereas HotSpot just shows the pixels with heat, without temperature calculation, and is simpler to run. 
```
**Danger**: DO NOT damage the probe needles nor microscope objectives.  If you are not careful, you can easily crash the microscope objective into the probe needles!

```

The microscope objectives may be impossible to replace, and the probe needles are setup for _Very_ low spacing between the microscope objectives, needles and sample stage. 
It is better if you can practice how to use a [Probe Station](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Probe_Station_%26_Curve_Tracer ""Probe Station & Curve Tracer"") in your own lab, or in the NanoFab before using this system. 
```
If you think the needles got bumped or damaged, please notify staff ASAP so we can take a look and replace them.

```

  1. **Contact staff for filling the Liquid Nitrogen (""LN2"") dewar the _day before_ your planned usage.**
  2. Use the small ~2 Liter container to fill LN2 for the MWIR microscope 
    1. You can tell when it's full when LN2 droplets spill out from the sides of the funnel's foam insert.
  3. Turn on the Temperature Controller power and the System Controller (turning the key to 1 and press the red Power button)
  4. Turn on the computer by clicking on the rocker switch once, behind the right-side panel. Ensure computer monitor is on. Motion Control will open automatically. Note the Z (focus) setting at Maximum speed 100%! Reduce to 25-50%.
  5. Open the Software: **Hotspot** for standard imaging, **ThermalMap** for more complex temperature measurements.
  6. Set up the electrical connection for the probes through the BNC cables according to your device, and turn on the Keithley power supply/SMU.
  7. Move the stage all the way forward with the front-most knob, put the sample on the stage, then move the stage back under the backmost microscope. ENSURE no probe needles are down, nor collide during this process! Do not touch the probe needles with your sample or tweezers.
  8. Move the probe manipulators to the right position to contact the device. CAREFUL - the magnetic bases can be hard to move, ensure nothing collides when making large movements. **In the Software:**
  9. Keep the temperature range the same, at ""Low"" (highest sensitivity).
  10. On the Turret tab: NIR is visible camera. MWIR is IR camera. Start on 1X Macro. Hit Go to switch to the Macro camera 
    1. Takes a few minutes while the system changes motorized objectives, lenses and cameras.
  11. Once done, click on the Video button.
  12. Go to the Light tab, to adjust illumination intensity.
  13. Find the probe & device in the microscope, then center it by double-clicking on it. 
    1. Move the stage to put the Device under the Probe needle.
    2. Move the camera with ""Motion Control"" or double-clicking on the screen.
  14. Hit Stop, it will freeze the image.
  15. Switch to the 5X NIR (visible) on the Turret tab and click on Go to switch the microscope and the lenses.
  16. Hit Video and go to the Light tab, change the illumination to a proper power. Don't Saturate the camera (white).
  17. Move the z up first and observe the stage to check for collisions/safety. Then set a slow speed for Z movement 25%. Slowly move the z down until see the probe in the center. Then continue moving down until sample is in focus. **KEEP watching the stage/objectives** **to ensure nothing collides.**
  18. Put the probe needles down to make electrical contact to your device and check it with the Keithley by looking at the current with the safe low voltage. Then turn off the Keithley output. 
    1. Do not adjust the stage position now that the probe needles are down!
  19. Switch the turret to MWIR (2x or 5x) and start imaging again use Focus IR to look for the hotspot.
  20. If using ThermalEmission: Click ""Background"" and watch the stage carefully to ensure the Shutter doesn't collide.
  21. Turn on and off the Keithley output to look for bright pixels. 
    1. You may need to adjust your electrical drive and microscope position with Motion Control. NOTE the motion speed setting, 25-50% is safe.
  22. _When you are ready to acquire a Hotspot image:_
  23. Set Max Averages to 20.
  24. Turn on Reference imaging with Keithley output off.
  25. Press Average [OFF] button to start acquiring the reference image. When it’s done
  26. Click Thermal Emission, turn on Keithley output, click the Average button to acquire the thermal image. 
    1. This is a difference image, subtracting the Live image from the Reference Image, which assumed to be 40°C.
  27. Adjust the threshold on the image to alter the transparent pixels. Also, under Analyze, look at histogram, or look at LineTrace by drawing a line, and click LinerTrace again.
  28. For saving data: Hit the [Printscreen] button on the keyboard. Then open Paint.exe on the Start Bar. Then go to EDIT and Paste the screenshot to save it.
  29. Save the file in your Nanofiles folder.
  30. In HotSpot/ThermalEmission: Go to FILE and Save image or Text file of the temperature date, or for region of interest (ROI, eg. LineTrace etc).


#### Ending your Session
  1. Unload the sample: 
    1. lift the probes.
    2. Move the stage **all the way forward** , after passing the probes.
  2. Turn off the Lamp inside the dark box.
  3. Please keep supplies and tweezers inside the dark box.
  4. Software: Go to file and quit.
  5. Sync the data with the ""_**Nanofiles Sync**_ "" program on the desktop. 
    1. Optionally check that the data is available on your laptop.
  6. Turn off the computer before you leave (Windows _**Start > Shutdown**_). Wait until it is shut down fully.
  7. On the System Controller, Turn the key to **0** to turn it off.
  8. Close the dark box.

### Load Sample into Chamber (Manual/Test Mode)
  1. Mount sample such that area to be monitored is located in the laser monitor's cutout window, as indicated by the Carrier wafer mounted to the tool and/or the glass slide showing the laser monitor location. 
    1. The locations on ICP#1 and ICP#2 are different.
  2. Load wafer into etch chamber 
    1. **_ICP#1_** Manual Load: 
      1. {Test} Mode soft-button
      2. Remove all wafers from cassettes
      3. Place only your sample wafer in the bottom slot (#1) on left cassette (No. 1)
      4. Check that cassette is seated properly. It will not map the cassette!
      5. F6 Test
      6. F1 Wf. Trans.
      7. F1 Wf TRWIN (""Throw In"")
      8. Confirm that Wafer #1 will be transferred into the E-Ch. (""Etching Chamber"")
      9. {Start} soft-button
    2. **_ICP#2_** Manual Load: 
      1. {Test} Mode soft-button
      2. Place Carrier wafer in load slot
      3. Menu Test > Trans/Test > Transport > Wafer Load
      4. {Start} soft-button


### Laser Monitor & Recipe setup
  1. Edit your ICP Recipe, make sure Step Time is longer than expected, to stop using the Manual Box instead of the recipe time.
  2. Laser Monitor Setup: (Windows: log in as _GeneralUser)_
    1. Launch ""**uEye** "" Camera software. 
      1. Start Camera feed
      2. Enable ""Auto Contrast""
      3. Enable ""Fit to Window""
    2. Turn on Illumination on laser head.
    3. Plug in Laser Interlock to turn on laser (RF connector on keychain) 
      1. Should see laser spot on wafer immediately. Can only see laser spot if a wafer is in the chamber, and laser is projected through the cutouts in the chamber heaters/casing.
    4. Adjust focus (small changes only), to minimize size of laser spot.
    5. **GREY knobs ONLY** to adjust X/Y. Place Laser on region to be monitored. 
      1. Do NOT adjust the Black tilt knobs! If you are not an optics guru, then you usually will only make a mess of this.
    6. Launch ""**Etch Director 2** "" Laser monitoring software 
      1. Check that Signal level is live (non-zero). Can block laser head with hand to ensure signal shows dramatic change.
      2. Make sure ""Endpoint"" panel does Not have ""Accept"" or ""Auto Go"" checked on any of the Endpoint tabs, or it may stop recording at some point.
      3. Make sure you have your simulation or a screenshot of the expected stopping point handy.
    7. {Start} & {Go} to begin laser monitoring


### Run the Etch while Monitoring
  1. Make sure you have your laser interferogram reference handy, so you know when to stop the etch. Eg. screenshot, simulation etc.
  2. Run your etch in ""Process Test"" Mode: 
    1. **_ICP#1:_**
      1. Make sure Manual Box has ""Etching Chamber Select"" Enabled, not another chamber. All Chambers should have ""Evacuate"" enabled""
      2. OPTIONALLY: Set switch to ""MR"" to use side keyboard/screen/manual box 
        1. Make sure Manual Box on that side has ""Evacuate"" enabled on all chambers!
        2. You must set this back to ""CR"" when you are done!
      3. {Test} mode soft-button (should already be enabled)
      4. F6 Test
      5. F2 Test
      6. F1 Etch Test
      7. F2 Selection
      8. Choose your recipe, edit if needed
      9. F4 Register
      10. **{Start} soft-button**
      11. F5 & F5 to exit out to main menu
      12. F3 Monitor > F1 E-Ch. to monitor the etch
    2. **_ICP#2:_**

# About
This tool is designed for high quality, precise, reproducible deposition of dielectric films for optical quality films. Metallic material is ion bombarded from a target material and a reactive ion beam of oxygen and/or nitrogen is aimed at the surface, creating a metal-oxide or nitride on the sample. The system is fully computer controlled to facilitate multi-layer stack recipes for high reflectivity or low reflectivity coatings. The system is load locked and can handle wafers up to 6” in diameter as well as small pieces. Sample rotation and angling is used to facilitate material quality and allows for sidewall coverage on non-planar surfaces. Uniformity is better than 1.5% over 6"" wafers and reproducibility is expected to be within one percent (with pre-dep calibration). The high-energy sputter deposition produces denser films than other techniques, improving optical damage threshold (and thus coating lifetime). This also causes the refractive indices to be slightly higher than comparable stoichiometric films deposited by other techniques. 
Four metallic targets can be installed (producing Oxides & Nitrides of each). Ta & Si are always available, the others are rotated out as users need them. 
The most common films for High-/Anti-Reflection (HR/AR) coatings are **SiO 2** & **Ta 2O5**, both of which are extremely stable w/r/to refractive index. Users typically calibrate their dep. rates prior to critical deps. & multi-layer coatings.

JEOL IT800SHL - Reduced Charging Imaging Modes,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/JEOL_IT800SHL_-_Reduced_Charging_Imaging_Modes,"_Techniques to reduce charging during your imaging session._
Samples accumulating electric charge during imaging is a common issue in the SEM. This typically manifests as the image drifting/shifting (blurring the image during slow photo acquisitions), astigmatism needing constant re-correction, and generally inability to get sharp images no matter the imaging conditions. 
The first and easiest method to reduce charging is to deposit a thin layer of Au/Pd onto your sample, and use clips to provide a path to from the sample surface to the grounded stage, as described here: 
  * [Hummer SEM Sample Coater - thin Au/Pd coating to reduce charging in SEMs](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Hummer_SEM_Sample_Coater_-_Techniques_to_reduce_charging_in_SEMs ""Hummer SEM Sample Coater - Techniques to reduce charging in SEMs"")


However the AuPd coating may not be acceptable for your devices (although gold etchant should be able to remove it). The following methods may work without AuPd coating, you can always add the AuPd later if needed. 
### Imaging conditions for reduced charging
Here are some settings to reduce charging: 
  * **Beam Voltage** (in databar on bottom of screen): **_1kV_**
  * Set ""**P.C.** "" (Probe Current, in databar) to: **_HD_ /High Definition** mode, and then **_75%_** current. 
    * HD mode increases resolution (smaller beam) but is lower current (higher noise), so sliding up to 75% increases SNR back to original levels.


  * Adjust **Wobble** first. Ok to do at lower magnifications. Use X/Y knobs to make image not shift laterally when defocused. 
    * Use ""**Lens Clear** "" function beforehand (right-click image and choose ""Lens Clear"")
    * Use ""**ABA** "" (Auto Beam Alignment) - faster than manual for low beam voltages
  * Adjust **Astigmatism ""Stig""** : see this video for tips: 
    * Adjust stig while observing an object with many angles (eg. dust/dirt) - avoid adjusting stig on an object with flat lines (eg. cleaved edge) or you will skew the image along that edge.
  * Switch to **[CF1]** or **[CF2]** acquisition modes for final image (next to Scan1/Scan2 etc) - ""Charge Free"" mode. 
    * Fast scans to reduce charging, but re-scans each line multiple times to reduce noise.
    * If you don't see these buttons, please ask the tool supervisor to add them to your user account.


### During imaging
  * Right-click the image and click ""**Lens Clear** "" - this removes residual magnetism in the lens and can help remove distortion, or make stig correction work better. Especially if you have trouble getting Wobble and Stig to align.
  * If you have set Wobble and Stigmator to ""no man's land"" (you're ""lost""), reset it with: **Alignment > OL Stigmator > [Reset All]**


  * Use ""**RDC** "" for optimizing image on a small, fast scan area before acquiring entire image.
  * Right-Click > **[Find Focus]** to auto-focus on a particular feature/location on the image.

### [Example CAD Files](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities#Example_CAD_File ""Calculators + Utilities"")
See the above link for example CAD files set up with Cells, Instancing, Origins and Layers setup as recommended. 
### Turn on Editing Mode
By default, KLayout might open as a ""viewer"" only, without draw-mode capabilities (no square/polygon/text buttons in the toolbar) and only ruler/zoom tools. Enable Editing mode as so: 
  * _**Preferences > Editing mode > [√] Use Editing Mode by default**_, and restart the software.


### Turn on the display of the Origin (0,0)
  * _**Preferences > Display > Background > Axis**_ = change from the default ""invisible"", eg. ""_**Lines**_ "".


### Minimum Step-Size / Database Unit
  * The default minimum unit of 0.001 µm (1nm) is usually fine. Don't change this after drawing - all polygons will be scaled accordingly. If you need finer resolution: _Before_ starting your design, set the _**Layout Properties > Database Unit**_ to something smaller, eg. 0.0001 µm.


### How to draw circles
  * You have to draw a square, and then apply the function **_Edit > Selection > Convert to PCell_ > Basic.CIRCLE**. (A P-Cell is a Cell with parameters - like a programmer's ""function"" with ""arguments"" of sorts.)
  * Sometimes these P-Cells don't convert properly at the photomask vendor, so make sure to run _**Edit > Selection > Convert to Static Cell**_ or _**Edit > Layout > Convert All Cells to Static**_ before sending to the vendor/machine, which converts to a regular polygon in a Cell. (You lose editing capabilities of the P-Cell when you do this.) 
    * Another way is to convert a square to a polygon directly with _**Edit >Selection>Round Corners**_ function with _**Outer Corner Radius**_ = the desired circle radius (radius is not changeable afterards in this method, but computation may be faster for a large number of objects).
    * Klayout doesn't natively support circles because the GDS file format does not have a ""circle"" primitive built-in, so instead it creates a polygon. Make sure you include enough polygon points, eg. 32. See the 


### How to draw Text
A common mistake is to use the “Text” tool to draw text that you want to get printed on the mask plate. 
**Only Polygons** will get printed on the final mask plate. To print text, you have to convert the Text tool objects into polygons as so: 
  * Use the **Text** Tool to place some text. These text objects are useful for comments/labels on a layout that won’t get printed.
  * select the text object
  * Use the function **Edit > Selection > Convert to PCell**
  * by default the PCell “**BASIC.TEXT** ” should be selected.
  * Select the object again if needed, and view the object’s Properties (**Edit > Properties**)
  * Here you can adjust the Size via the “ _Magnification_ ” parameter, the text string, and other useful properties.


Note that the default font has enclosed spaces, which is sometimes non-optimal for lift-off processes. See this hint for 
### Cells & Instances of Cells
It is highly recommended that you understand and use the concept of ""**Cells** "" & ""**Instances** "" in your design. This is critical for direct-write machines ([EBL](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_Lithography_System_\(JEOL_JBX-6300FS\)), [MLA](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Maskless_Aligner_\(Heidelberg_MLA150\)), Mask-writing vendors), and if used properly, helps tremendously with programming the Stepper lithography machines. This functionality also circumvents many problems with enormous file sizes (due to huge numbers of identical polygons), by ""pointing"" to the same polygon only defined once in the file. Links to documentation below: 
  * Create a new cell, and instancing that cell: 
  * Viewing only some levels of the Cell heirarchy, to prevent drawing all objects: 
  * Video Tutorials: 


### File Types
#### GDS vs. OASIS format
OASIS format is the successor to the GDS format, and is the preferred format, except that some software (eg. Heidelberg) doesn't yet accept it natively. Instead most users do all their editing in OASIS, and convert to GDS only for use on those specific tools that require it. All Photomask vendors accept OASIS format. OASIS files tend to be much smaller than GDS files, and they also save the Layer Names (not just Layer Number). KLayout converts between OASIS and GDS without issue - so you can easily convert to GDS for those tools that need it. See 
GDS files are considered ""standard"", but are somewhat antiquated: they lose the text names of layers between saves and can be 1000x larger file size than OASIS files (even when ""zipped"" in .gds.gz). The Heidelberg software ([MLA150](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Maskless_Aligner_\(Heidelberg_MLA150\) ""Maskless Aligner \(Heidelberg MLA150\)"")) only accepts GDS as the preferred format, not OASIS, so users typically save as GDS right before the MLA150 write. 
#### Save your editing session
In KLayout the function **File > Save Session** will save the entire view including layer styles and window/zoom locations will be saved. You can share this file, as the entire design file is embedded within it, but it may not be as robust between KLayout versions. During editing, this is a helpful function to avoid losing your place. 
#### DXF Format
DXF files coming from AutoCAD often are missing the ""units"", and may erroneously map millimeters to meters, causing your design to be scaled 1000x too large. You can fix this in _**File > Reader Options > DXF**_, or simply instance the entire design into a new Cell with Magnification set to correct the scaling error. Also, AutoCAD allows for non-closed polygons, which are invalid shapes (even though the start/end points lie on top of each other, the shape is not technically ""closed"" unless you use polyline-edit ""_PEDIT_ "" and intentionally Close them). The DXF Reader has some options to catch/fix these. 
### Non-Orthogonal Arrays
Arrays created with diagonal instancing (non-orthogonal arrays) can be incompatible with photomask vendor's mask writing software. 
We recommend you avoid the grey X and Y fields shown below when creating arrays, as shown here: 
[![Klayou screenshot showing non-orthogonal array definition](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/24/KLayout_-_Non-Orthogonal_Arrays.png/485px-KLayout_-_Non-Orthogonal_Arrays.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:KLayout_-_Non-Orthogonal_Arrays.png)
If you do need to use a non-orthogonal array, make sure to use _**Selection > Resolve Arrays**_ before submitting your design to the manufacturer/machine. 
### Handling very large files
If you will be generating millions of identical shapes (eg. repeating array of circles), the file size can quickly become enormous due to all the stored polygon points. You can reduce the number of polygon points stored by: 
  1. Reduce the number of points in each shape/circle if possible. Gentle corners will be rounded by the lithography resolution.
  2. Use Cell instancing so that only one, or a few, polygons are defined, and that same polygon is then only referenced as a repeating Cell instance. (See above for tutorials).
  3. The OAS file type generates much smaller files, and most photomask vendors can accept this. Photomask vendors are used to handling large files.
  4. Photomask vendors are able to take multiple files and insert them into the final reticle – you just need to provide a clear schematic showing the exact insertion coordinates for each file (with respect to the origin of each file). They can also do some boolean operations (for a fee).


### Saving layer styles
If you change the colors/styles of Layer display, Klayout doesn't save those into it's global preferences. Instead, you can either _**File > [Save Session](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips#Save_your_editing_session)**_ or _**File > Save Layer Properties**_. Layer Properties files (*.lyp) contain the layer display styles. You can either open these files manually via _**File > Load Layer Properties**_ or set KLayout to automatically load any Layer Properties files with the same name as the currently loaded CAD file, as 
[![Screenshot of KLayout settings to auto-load layer properties](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/4/44/KLayout_-_auto-load_layer_properties_screenshot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:KLayout_-_auto-load_layer_properties_screenshot.png)KLayout > Setup > Application:Layer PropertiesSet to `$(combine(path(layoutfile),basename(layoutfile))+"".lyp"")`From 
This way, if you have two files: 
  * `MyCADDesign.gds` (or `.oas`), and
  * `MyCADDesign.lyp` - layer properties


KLayout will automatically load the layer properties when it loads the OAS/GDS file. 
By default `Automatically add other layers` is enabled, so any layers that aren't in your CAD file will be created and left empty - disabling this _won't_ create those empty layers.

##  Summary
While working in the Nanofab, you are surrounded by hazardous chemicals and gases, high voltages, radiation, and mechanical systems. It is impossible to define a policy for every conceivable situation. 
**The responsibility lies with users and staff to act in a professional, courteous, and safe manner at all times while in the facility.** The Nanofab culture relies on self-discipline to follow policies, respect for each other, and careful considerate treatment of facility property that is needed for project success. Everyone’s work is equally important and the basic rule of treating others how you would like to be treated sets the framework for many policies in the facility. As a group we expect all users and staff to help maintain the safety and integrity of the Nanofab. 
The Nanofab is not a teaching lab or a course in processing. The users are expected to have prior cleanroom experience and understand any chemistry or process used. All users should employ common sense and a high degree of prudence while working in this facility. Users violating the operating and safety rules of the facility or endangering the safety of themselves or other users may be denied further access to the facility. 
This document attempts to define acceptable actions and behavior for the users of the Nanofabrication facility and contains extensive safety related information on common hazards and work practices and procedures within the facility.

### UCSB Laboratory Hazardous Assessment Tool (LHAT)
Since there are multiple users of the facility, with their own unique projects, the management of the facility cannot be responsible for overseeing all aspects of their work. Therefore, the supervisors of individuals using the facility, e.g., UCSB **Principal Investigators (PIs) and external user PIs or managers are ultimately responsible for ensuring that their supervisees have the appropriate knowledge and training to work safely in the facility.** They are also responsible for ensuring that all applicable regulatory requirements are met. This includes having a compliant ""**Chemical Hygiene Plan"" per OSHA regulations**. The information in this document and on the [UCSB Nanofab wiki site](https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki), <https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki>, should be considered as providing ""general supporting information"" to the Chemical Hygiene Plan of a particular supervisor. Supervisors can reference all or some of this information within their Plans, but this document does not constitute a complete plan. UCSB EH&S can provide assistance to supervisors in preparing their Plans. 
### Laboratory Orientation and Initial Training
All new users must take the initial fundamentals of laboratory safety course offered through the UC learning center. Additionally, there is a mandatory general orientation and in-lab wet bench training that is required. Contact the facility operational director to request access. 
While in the laboratory, all personnel will wear facility provided bunny-suits, gloves, and Z87+ rated safety glasses at all times, unless noted by a specific policy exception. 
### Chemical Bench Use Authorization
There is a mandatory wet bench training that every user needs to attend before accessing any of the chemistry or wet benches, including simple rinsing with water. Please contact the operations manager for training. 
### Lab Storage of User-Specific Materials 
#### Rules and allocation
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/4b/Lab_Rules_-_1.4.1_shelf_space.png/127px-Lab_Rules_-_1.4.1_shelf_space.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.4.1_shelf_space.png)
All Nanofab storage shelf space and the blue containers are controlled by the Nanofab. It is not open use. Please contact Bill Millerski (wmillerski@ucsb.edu) for new or additional shelf space. It is assigned by group or company. There is a finite shelf space so please first check within your own group to make sure shelf space is optimized and old users’ boxes have been removed or re-assigned before contacting Bill. Extra blue bins, lids and dividers are stored in the gowning room for use. **Please do not use any other boxes on the shelves except for the blue bins provided by the Nanofab. If boxes are left out or stored on the wrong shelves they will be removed from the lab. Additionally, the Nanofab is not a long term storage facility and users should regularly review what they and their groups are storing in the lab so that items no longer needed can be removed to make room for others that may need the space.**
A user’s job in the facility is not complete until all user-specific materials have been cleaned up and put away. All users are given space to store user-specific materials within the facility in a neat, organized fashion. In order to have space for everyone to work, all users must clean up their personal items and store them before leaving the lab for any time longer than a 30-minute break. Storage boxes found without the user being in the lab will be removed from the lab and stored in a secure location. The group/user name will be placed on a list in the facility that users can check to determine if their box has been taken by staff. The current location for this list is on the cabinet in service chase 4. Users will need to contact a staff member to retrieve boxes. There will be a charged fee of 30 minutes of staff time for each incident and this will be noted on the invoice. For continued violations there will be an escalation of consequences: 
1st offense: fee 
2nd offense within 12 months: fee 
3rd time offense within 12 months: fee and warning of impending suspension 
4th time offense within 12 months: fee, 2 day suspension, and supervisor notification 
5th time offense within 12 months: fee, minimum 3 days suspension, and personal discussion with user and supervisor. 
#### Dry-Box/Dessicator
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/86/Lab_Rules_-_1.4.2_dry_box.png/111px-Lab_Rules_-_1.4.2_dry_box.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.4.2_dry_box.png)
There is a large desiccator located in the main corridor close to Bays 6-7 along the wall. Users can store any sensitive materials in the desiccator. **It will need to have the group identification, user contact info and date on each container**. Each user/group must clean out old or unused material. Occasionally the staff will announce and clean out the cabinet of outdated materials. This unit is NOT for long term storage of materials, but for materials being actively processed in the facility. 
#### ASML Mask Storage
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8c/Lab_Rules_-_1.4.3_ASML_masks.png/122px-Lab_Rules_-_1.4.3_ASML_masks.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.4.3_ASML_masks.png)
There is also shelf space for ASML mask plates behind the ASML Stepper. **Only ASML masks can be stored on that shelf**. All other photo-masks need to be stored in your blue containers or removed from the lab when not in use. You will be allowed to use the ASML shelf after official training on the ASML stepper. The shelf space is controlled by Demis D. John, [demis@ece.ucsb.edu](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""). The Nanofab is not a long term storage facility. When a mask set will no longer be used, the users are responsible for removing these masks from the facility and storing them at another location. If items need to be kept clean, users should bag them in sealable bags before taking them out of the cleanroom. 
### Lab Suspensions
The lab has been operating for many years. Over this time it has been determined that there exist some fundamental rules and procedures that must be maintained to provide both a safe and productive environment. While it does not happen often and we do not want to prevent users from completing their work we have found that suspensions from the lab are sometimes necessary and must be taken seriously. The lab relies on an honor system as staff can’t be there at all times to maintain compliance. While working in the lab, we rely on users to follow all written and oral procedures (even if inconvenient) and to treat others with respect, honoring both the person and their work as you would your own. The lab has a large user base of more than 600 active users annually. Most infractions have warnings first and this is most often all that is needed. The goal of suspensions is to change behavior to conform to the rules and policies set forth in this document. Suspension durations will escalate until behaviors are changed to conform to the facility rules. Continued refusal to follow the facility policies and guidelines may result in eventual expulsion from facility use. PPE and other human safety violations at the wet benches should be expected to result in an immediate suspension. The duration of any suspension and any further escalation will be determined by the laboratory management after consideration of the events. At the exclusive discretion of the operational director, in addition to or in lieu of suspension, we may require a re-reading of this policy and the taking of a refresher quiz for violations. **We will contact your PI or supervisor to acknowledge any suspension**. Please be aware of this policy. If you are found in non-compliance with any policy it is your fault alone and no one else’s. You should handle this in the appropriate manner and correct your own behavior. 
### Iris Camera and Card Access System
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/a/a0/Lab_Rules_-_1.6_iris_scanner.png/94px-Lab_Rules_-_1.6_iris_scanner.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.6_iris_scanner.png)
The Iris Camera and Card Access System provides security to the Nanofab, and allows tracking of the time each user spends in the Nanofab. **Always scan in when entering the lab and scan out when exiting the lab, even when attending training sessions or performing beneficial work.** The only exception to this rule is entering as a visitor as defined in the visitor policy below. **Willful Violation this policy will result in suspension.** This policy is both for safety (knowing who is in the lab in case of emergencies) and for fair, accurate billing of facility resources. 
#### After Hours Access
The building is open from 7am to 6pm M-F, excluding holidays. During all other hours, the building is electronically locked. After hour access can be gained by using the iris reader or WHITE card reader on the south entrance (mountains are north, not the main entrance) 
### Visitor Policy 
#### Badges
Visitor badges can be obtained from the staff during the normal weekday hours and removes any confusion about the shadowing of another user without logging in. As a nonpaying person, a visitor can’t touch any equipment, computers or chemicals in the lab. We offer this policy as a courtesy so please do not abuse it as it can also be removed. The visitor badge must be worn outside the bunnysuit and be clearly visible at all times. 
#### Shadowing
We encourage new users to shadow current users as a visitor to become familiar with the Nanofab before beginning actual work. To accomplish this, registered users may come in as visitors, with a badge, in order to watch and learn how processes are done. A logged-in user and visitor may not exchange roles while in the cleanroom together. Only the actively logged-in user may operate/touch/use any equipment in the laboratory. No exceptions. 
#### Visiting Researchers
Professional, non-registered visitors such as research collaborators or new students in a research group can be brought into the lab to observe with the permission of laboratory staff during normal operating hours (8am-5pm M-F). Off-hours permission to bring in professional visitors will be evaluated on request by the operational director or co-manager. 
#### Non-professional visitors
Non-professional visitors such as family members and friends can be brought into the lab during normal hours (8am-5pm M-F) only with permission of the operational director or co-manager. In general, these types of visits can be most effectively done looking through the windows of the long South hallway. 
#### Visitor Rules
Any official user can bring in a visitor in to the Nanofab under the guidelines given above to observe the lab operation. The official user is wholly accountable for the visitor’s safety, correct gowning and adherence to the visitor policy. Please do not take this privilege lightly as we don’t want anyone to be injured while in the lab as a visitor. 
#### Groups
Any “group” tour (3 or more people) inside the facility needs prior approval of the operational director or co-manager. Please give ample time when requesting. 
#### Violations
The Nanofab relies on the honor system and the visitor “observation only” policy is clear. **If users are caught violating the visitor policy and operating/handling anything in the lab while being a visitor both the official user host and the visitor will be suspended from the lab without exception.**
### Credit for Beneficial Work in the Nanofab
#### Rules for Credit
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/d/d4/Lab_Rules_-_1.8.1_beneficial_time_sheet.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.8.1_beneficial_time_sheet.png)
You can receive a time credit for each hour of beneficial time given to the facility. The time you are in the lab for the beneficial time is subtracted from the invoice and an additional benefit of 0.5 hours for each hour is given as a credit. Beneficial time includes: 
  1. performing maintenance on lab equipment,
  2. conducting training sessions for other groups (not for your own research group), or
  3. any time spent performing work beneficial to the general operation of the lab.


Please indicate time spent performing beneficial work on the sign-up sheet just inside the gowning room, with a description of what you did/who you worked with. The lab director will ultimately determine if the credit is given. 
#### Determining Nanofab beneficial lab time credit
The two common ways for logging beneficial time: 
  1. If you help staff with Nanofab related work such as maintenance, construction or cleanup of equipment or the lab. 
  2. If you happen to help/train someone outside of your group, unplanned, while you are logged in to the Nanofab. Please review the below paragraphs to understand other situations. 


#### Training within your group
When you are training a group member or any other user, the correct way to enter the Nanofab is to log in and then take the user in as a visitor with a Visitor Badge. We assume that you are training while you are performing your own work and the other user is _only observing_. Only one user can be using the equipment and that user should be charged for their use. 
  * **This should not be logged as beneficial time as the visitor is not charged.**


The other method would be for the new user that is being trained to log in and you will go in as the visitor. This will allow the new user to handle and operate systems while you observe his use as the visitor and give verbal guidance. 
  * **This should not be logged as beneficial time as the visitor is not charged.**


### User Responsibilities regarding Housekeeping
#### Work Surfaces
Leave all workspaces (wet benches, table tops, and system work surfaces, etc.) **clean** , **dry, and organized**. This includes cleaning up all spills and residues, storing glassware and chemicals, throwing away used wipes and Aluminum dishes, etc. 
If a workspace is not clean when you start a task, you still have the responsibility to leave it clean. 
**If you leave any workspace in disarray, or leave an unlabeled container on any workspace, you can be suspended from the Nanofab.** Please kindly remind other users to clean up after themselves if you see them leaving a mess and to label their containers when needed. 
#### Wet Benches
For wet benches in particular: Do not cover the exhaust holes on the bench tops with wipes or foil, as this will impede the laminar flow of air through the bench and possibly expose you or other Nanofab users to toxic fumes. Glassware may be left to dry on the racks or, for large containers, at the back of the bench only while you are working in the lab. When you leave the lab, you are responsible for drying and putting away all of your glassware. A user’s job in the facility is not complete until all user-specific materials have been cleaned up and put away. 
##### Glassware Confiscation Policy
Glassware left out to dry after you leave the lab for the day may be confiscated and put into a secure location for a time, before being disposed of. The group/user name will be placed on a list in the facility that users can check to determine if their materials have been taken by staff. The current location for this list is on the cabinet in service chase 4, and all Staff have key-access to this cabinet. 
Make sure your glassware/wafer holders have a group name written on them. Items with no user or group name are subject to disposal. If you ask staff to retrieve your glassware and it is found, your PI/advisor/supervisor will be charged a fee of 30 minutes of staff time and this will be noted on the invoice. For continued violations there will be an escalation of consequences: 
1st offense: fee 
2nd offense within 12 months: fee 
3rd time offense within 12 months: fee and warning of impending suspension 
4th time offense within 12 months: fee, 2 day suspension, and supervisor notification 
5th time offense within 12 months: fee, minimum 3 days suspension, and personal discussion with user and supervisor. 
#### Sharps Disposal
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/27/Lab_Rules_-_1.9.3_glass_sharps_waste.png/77px-Lab_Rules_-_1.9.3_glass_sharps_waste.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.9.3_glass_sharps_waste.png)
The sharps bins located around the lab should be used for any material, supplies, broken beakers, syringe tips, etc. that would penetrate through trash bags and possibly injure one of the custodians while they empty the waste. If glass is broken in the cleanroom, please notify staff via nanofab@ece.ucsb.edu so that we can assist in cleaning this up in a timely manner. 
### Nanofab Paper and Cardboard
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/5f/Lab_Rules_-_1.10.1_supplies_racks_NanoFab_paper.png/100px-Lab_Rules_-_1.10.1_supplies_racks_NanoFab_paper.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.10.1_supplies_racks_NanoFab_paper.png)
The only paper allowed in the lab is cleanroom type paper. We provide/stock cleanroom paper, cleanroom notebooks and binders in the gowning room. You can laminate regular paper for use in the lab. Use pens, not pencils, for writing in the lab. No cardboard is allowed in the nanofab. 
### NanoFab Wipes & Napkins
We stock four types of wipes in the lab: 
#### S/Pec-Wipe 3
This is a cellulose/polyester blend with high absorption but medium particle and fiber generation. 
#### Berkshire Poly1200
This is a 100% knit polyethylene wipe with low particulate generation, but also with relatively low absorption. (This kind of wipe is expensive and only available upon special request) 
#### PRO-STAT
This is a cellulose blend presaturated with isopropyl alcohol and DI water. 
#### BIOHAZ
These are used to line photoresist spinner catch bowls. 
#### Rules for Napkins and WIpes
  1. Use wipes sparingly. They should not be treated like paper towels. Take the few extra moments to **only grab the number you really need**. This reduces a lot of unnecessary waste & cost.
  2. Do not place wipes on the sink trays or sink bottoms. 
  3. Dispose of used wipes in the proper manner. Wipes that have Photoresist or solvents on them should never be thrown in the trash, but should be placed in the proper waste bins located in the backs of the exhausted benches.


### **Preparing Equipment for Entry into the Nanofab**
All equipment entering the lab must be clean. The procedure for cleaning equipment for entry is: 
#### Large Equipment
  1. Vacuum while equipment is outside the lab. 
  2. Wipe down all accessible surfaces with propanol using Nanofab wipes or presaturated propanol wipes while equipment is outside the lab. 
  3. Move equipment into the lab 
  4. Vacuum with HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner when inside the lab. 


#### Small Equipment
  1. Blue boxes, laptops, cell phones, tablets, etc. can be wiped down with the presaturated alcohol/DI water wipes in the gowning room before entering, if dirty. 


### Maintenance Ways
  1. You may enter maintenance ways (""Chases"") without wearing a bunnysuit from outside the Nanofab, or while wearing a bunnysuit from inside the Nanofab. 
  2. In general, there are no user-serviceable facilities in the maintenance ways. Unless instructed otherwise by NanoFab staff, no user shall adjust or address anything in the service ways, including all regulators, gas bottles, valves, electrical power systems, exhaust dampers, backing pumps, chillers, etc. Staff should be called in the case of issues in the service chases.[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/f6/Lab_Rules_-_1.13.1_maintenance_chase_doors.png/140px-Lab_Rules_-_1.13.1_maintenance_chase_doors.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.13.1_maintenance_chase_doors.png)


### Notes on Particle Counts in the Nanofab
  1. The Nanofab has historically been surveyed with a particle counter, with generally good results. All laminar flow, wet bench work surfaces have extremely low particle counts, better than class 10. The open areas in the lithography area are all better than class 100, and mostly better than class 10. The remainder of the Nanofab tests better than class 1000, and often better than class 100. The Nanofab design specifications stipulated class 100 for litho, class 1000 for everything else. The Nanofab is easily meeting these specs. 
  2. The effectiveness of facemasks was investigated by placing the particle counter directly under a person’s neck while the person moved his head back and forth. Facemasks reduced particle counts, from the equivalent of class 500 without masks to class 100 with masks. Again, this was sampling just below the neck, not at typical substrate surfaces. If you need to inspect your parts very close to your face for any reason, you should consider using a face mask. There are two types of facemasks provided in the gowning room. Please choose the appropriate mask for your requirements.
  3. The choice of wipes used in the Nanofab has a more pronounced effect on particle counts. In general, wipes trade absorbency for low particle generation. The Spec-Wipe 3 is the stocked polyester/cellulose blend, high absorbency wipe designed for use in class 100 cleanrooms. Dragging the sampling tube across the surface of a Spec-Wipe 3 resulted in a class 1000 level particle counts. The Berkshire Polx 1200 wipe is the stocked low particle count, 100% knit polyester wipe. This wipe is far less absorbent than the Spec-Wipe 3, but generates fewer particles. Dragging the sampling tube across the surface of a Berkshire Polx 1200 wipe resulted in lower than class 100 level particle counts. The main point to note is that abrasion of fabric surfaces results in higher particle counts. When processing, try not to scrape the wipes while handling your parts.[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/1d/Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png/97px-Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png)


### Procedure for the Use and Handling of Precious Metals
  1. All precious metals (as well as other materials paid for by the Nanofab) are the property of the Nanofab. They are not to be used for any other purpose than for use within Nanofab systems. The materials must remain in the Nanofab at all times.
  2. Gold, platinum, palladium, and various alloys of these metals are stocked by the UCSB Nanofab and are provided for in the hourly recharge fee. Each research group can be issued a precious metal supply. You should check with your group first before contacting the Nanofab. Please contact the Nanofab Director for precious metals, thibeault@ece.ucsb.edu.[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/53/Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.png/89px-Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.png)
  3. This supply must be stored in a small lockable container, along with a log sheet for recording the use of these metals. Precious metals, the lockable security container, and log sheets will be issued by the Nanofab manager. All use of precious metals must be accurately recorded on the log sheet, and include user name, date, metal type, metal weight before use, and metal weight after use. **Any discrepancies, such as over use or loss of the precious metals will be invoiced to the responsible group/company. Loss of a precious metal lock box will be reported to the local UCSB police and will elevate the issue as this is may constitute theft.** Please make sure you are careful with your metal supply as you would be with your own money. 
  4. Every group is responsible for keeping their supply of precious metals up to date and full. But since all users are sharing the same lab supply of provided metals it is fine to share metals between groups if there are extenuating circumstances that prevented a group from having sufficient precious metal supply. It must be correctly noted in the other group’s log sheets that metal was used.
  5. To request more metals, email the operational director your request and leave the lockbox in the labeled blue bin located on the wire rack in the gowning room entryway. You will be notified by email when the metal has been replenished and your box has been returned to the blue bin.[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/c/c7/Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.png/151px-Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.png)
  6. Multiple digital scales have been acquired and placed throughout the Nanofab to facilitate weighing of these metals. When requesting additional precious metals, the completed log sheet must be presented to the Nanofab manager. Any discrepancies or loss in recorded precious metal use will result in charges to the principle investigator/company corresponding to the value of the precious metal missing. 
  7. Any loose precious metal lock boxes left out or any loose unmarked precious metals found in the lab either in a plastic bags, tins or individually laying on the floor should be returned to the lab manager for reclaim. 


### Surveillance Cameras
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/4/47/Lab_Rules_-_1.16_surveillance_camera.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_1.16_surveillance_camera.png)
Human and equipment safety is very important in the Nanofab. The Nanofab uses a full facility 24-hour camera recording system to improve safety within the laboratory. Up to 14 days of footage is recorded on 20 cameras. This recorded footage is regularly checked at various locations for safety violations. The footage may also used when violations of safety and policy are reported by users. Users observed to be violating policies on the recordings will be contacted by the management for further discussions. 
## **Facility Equipment Policies**
### Getting Trained on Equipment
The systems in the nanofabrication facility require operational training before authorization. Please contact tool owners for training as indicated on signupmonkey (described later) or on the lab wiki. All training is scheduled on an as-needed basis. During training on a piece of equipment, users should take notes and pay attention to all instructions given. Many systems have basic operating procedures to remind you of operation, but may not contain all of the information you need to successfully operate the system. Users are responsible for following written and oral instructions for the equipment. The tool pages of the laboratory wiki should also contain procedures that you can refer to ([Tool List](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tool_List ""Tool List"")). If you are unsure about any aspect of operation of a system after training, please ask the engineer or senior users of the equipment for assistance. Please do not be embarrassed to ask for more details about training. It is much more important to understand the systems as we want to prevent failures. Some operation failures will prevent many users from being able to finish their work, take systems down for extended periods, and cost the lab money for repairing the damage to the tool. Occasionally we will need to share the cost of the repair with the group/company that damaged the system, if pure negligence is determined as the cause. 
### Machine sign-up and use
Most systems require web-based sign-up. (http://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu,see below) for reservations. 
  1. You must be trained and authorized before you can sign-up and use a facility system.
  2. There is a 15 minute grace period for you to use your time slot or someone else is allowed to use the system. If you don’t show for your time slot then any user can take all of your consecutive time slots not just that specific slot. It is the registered user's responsibility to make sure there is a note at the tool if they will show up later than 15 minutes before the beginning of their time slot in order to prevent another user from taking the reservation times for themselves on the system.
  3. If you show up to a system and the scheduled user is not there, but you want to use the system, you need to first attempt to contact the user. Phone numbers and emails are accessible on signupmonkey. You should also look around the lab to see if the person is present as they may be doing something like etch/characterization cycles that require them to step away from the system for short times. Only after making reasonable effort to contact the user may you take the slots at the 15-minute mark after the start of the reservation. If you take the time slots, please press the ""Did Not Show"" button on the appropriate time slot in the signup system.
  4. Schedule enough time for all procedures you need to perform so that you will not encroach on the next user’s time slot. This includes all pre-and post-cleaning of the tools, where applicable. **This is every user’s responsibility and will result in suspensions if you abuse the system.** The next user is not responsible for your scheduling issues. Do not take “extra” slots to buffer around your schedule, instead give yourself adequate time between process steps to accommodate difficulties. The Nanofab staff tracks and resolves non-shows and users that abuse the system. 
  5. It is mandatory to fill in the appropriate information in the log books for each piece of equipment in the lab. This is often the only record of actual use and is necessary for any troubleshooting of equipment issues. **Willful non-compliance or repeated failures will result in suspensions.**


### **Machine error response and reporting issues**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/dd/Lab_Rules_-_2.3_equipment_maintaner_contact_sign.png/178px-Lab_Rules_-_2.3_equipment_maintaner_contact_sign.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_2.3_equipment_maintaner_contact_sign.png)
To report a system issue, go to the signup system and press the “**Report Tool Issue** ” button. This will send emails to the users and text messages to the tool supervisors. After pressing this button, you may directly contact the responsible engineer. Contact information for each responsible staff engineer is found directly above the tool, on signupmonkey, or on the wiki page. There is also a general mail list, nanofab@ece.ucsb.edu to all cleanroom staff for general questions or problems and for reporting issues with systems not on signupmonkey. The staff engineer will give training and post procedures for tool operation. Without proper training or posted procedures, users may not clear out errors or try undocumented procedures to get samples out of machines. They must contact the responsible engineer for assistance. All errors and issues must be entered in the tool log books. 
  1. All issues, whether or not they are your fault, need to be promptly reported to the system engineer. Mistakes are tolerated and may result in required retraining, but **hiding mistakes is immediate grounds for lab suspension.**
  2. **System Alarms** : If a system alarms, use the “**Report Tool Issue** ” button on the signupmonkey, then the responsible engineer should be contacted for assistance, either by cell phone if at a reasonable time or by email. Do not attempt to fix the problem unless you have training from the responsible engineer. Sometimes after normal staff working hours machines will be down until the next working day. Please note in the log books that there is a problem with the tool and that the staff has been contacted.
  3. **Software problems:** Unless written directions are given at the system or training given by the responsible engineer, follow the same procedure as a system alarm regarding software problems. Do not restart the computer unless instructed to do so.
  4. Please always use the “**Report Tool Issue** ” button in signupmonkey to report the issue so that the nanofab staff and subsequent users will be made aware of the issue. Then directly contact the tool engineer. For tools not on signupmonkey, send email to [


### Equipment Maintenance
All equipment is maintained by the professional staff. Users are not allowed to remove panels or alter subsystems within the machine unless directed to by staff. Significant electrical dangers including high voltage and high power RF exist within the panels of most machines. 
### Preventative Maintenance
This is done regularly on most tools to “reset” the tool to acceptable performance levels. If you believe a tool is not performing properly, please contact the responsible engineer and process support staff to discuss the problem. 
### Hotplate use
We have many hot plates in the facility used for a variety of applications. 
  1. Hot plates used for heating chemicals must be attended. This means you must be in the Nanofab and monitoring the hot plate whenever it is in use. This does not apply to PR baking hotplates that are built in to the PR spinner benches or to hotplates in the solvent benches used for heating photoresist strippers. [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/7/79/Lab_Rules_-_2.6.1_spinner_bench_hotplates.png/195px-Lab_Rules_-_2.6.1_spinner_bench_hotplates.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_2.6.1_spinner_bench_hotplates.png)
  2. The nine built-in PR baking hotplates are preset at certain temperatures. They should not be changed unless you are directed by Nanofab staff. There are other freestanding hotplates to be used for custom temperatures. Please contact staff if you have any questions.
  3. Every group/company should have a temperature measuring device (thermometer, thermocouple or bi-metal sensor) to check hotplate temperatures. We check and calibrate the built-in, lift-pin, and the large wafer round hotplates weekly. But hotplates can fail or users may wrongly change standard temperatures so every user is accountable for verifying hotplate temperature before use. Please contact staff, hopkins@ece.ucsb.eduor day@ece.ucsb.eduwhen hotplates have failed or are out of specifications.
  4. The hotplates cannot be reserved. Please be conscientious about your hotplate use. Everyone needs to use them often so if you have a unique process that requires long baking or heating, contact Nanofab staff for a long term solution.
  5. All heated beaker chemistry must be covered by a watch glass or some type of cover (foil or custom cover). You can cut handles of wafer/piece carriers to be below the beaker cover or notch them to have a handle protrude thru the cover. **There are no exceptions to this rule.**
  6. Heated chemicals are more reactive and hot plates should be kept towards the back of the benches to minimize the possibility of being knocked over accidently and to minimize the possibility of exposure if a beaker breaks/cracks or is spilled while heated. 
  7. Please leave hotplates in a clean condition. Do not contaminate the hotplate surface with solders, resists, low melting point metals or any other material that would jeopardize other user’s materials. It is every user’s responsibility to clean or check hotplates before and after use for any issues. A few extra minutes of cleaning up after ourselves makes the lab a better place for everyone to work. 


## **Visual and Audible Alarms in the Nanofab**
### **Fire Alarm**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/f3/Lab_Rules_-_3.1_fire_and_gas_alarms.png/129px-Lab_Rules_-_3.1_fire_and_gas_alarms.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_3.1_fire_and_gas_alarms.png)
A fire alarm is indicated by a white strobe light on red boxes marked fire and sound off with a high volume audible alarm. These are located throughout the Nanofab. If this alarm activates, immediately leave the Nanofab through the nearest exit and proceed to exit the building. Do not take care of your samples, do not keep working in any way, and do not remove your bunnysuit until you are outside the building. 
### **Toxic Gas Alarm**
A toxic/flammable gas alarm is indicated by blue strobe lights on gray boxes and sound off with a high volume audible alarm. These are located at both ends of each bay. There are two levels for this alarm, the Single Bay Toxic Alarm (low-level) and the All Bays Toxic Alarm (high-level), which are set based on health and explosion limits of the particular gases being detected. The detection satellites for these gases are located in various locations in the vicinity of the equipment that use these gases 
### **Single Bay Toxic Alarm**
For a Single Bay Toxic Alarm, the blue strobe and audible alarm will only be active in one bay. Under these conditions, users may not remain in or enter that bay until the staff have isolated the issue and allow users back in the bay. Users may continue to use the rest of the Nanofab. 
### **All Bays Toxic Alarm**
For an All Bays Toxic Alarm a high level of dangerous gas has been detected. All blue strobes and audible alarms will be active in all bays. When this occurs, all users are to immediately leave the laboratory, and then the building, through the closest exits. Do not take care of your samples, do not keep working in any way, and do not remove your bunnysuit until you are outside the building. 
### **Wet Bench Alarms**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/9c/Lab_Rules_-_3.3_wet_bench_overhead_controls.png/243px-Lab_Rules_-_3.3_wet_bench_overhead_controls.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_3.3_wet_bench_overhead_controls.png)
Small illuminated visual alarms with buzzers. Each wet bench may have multiple labeled alarms. You must follow proper response if you see or hear a wet bench alarm. 
#### Pump Lift station alarm
If the pump lift station alarm is activated all water will be shut off to the bench. Contact Nanofab staff. 
#### Exhaust Alarm
If the lighted/audible red exhaust alarm indicator located on the upper bench panel is activated then you must leave the bench area. The bench is no longer safe to work at due to low exhaust levels. If all bench exhaust alarms are activated then you must leave the Nanofab. This condition usually indicates one or more of the lab exhaust fans has failed. This will make the entire lab un-safe for occupancy. De-gown as you would normally while exiting the Nanofab. Contact Nanofab staff. 
### Equipment Alarms
Please notify supervisor of tool if equipment alarm is activated using phone, personal email, or nanofabstaff@ece.ucsb.edu. 
### Re-entering the lab after evacuation
Users may re-enter the facility after an evacuation condition only after the laboratory facility manager has authorized re-entry. No exceptions. 
## **Emergencies and First Aid**
### **Personal Injury – Chemical**
**If you have been exposed to a toxic substance or gas, if appropriate rinse in one of the emergency showers for a minimum 15 minutes.**
**In all cases, quickly get to the emergency room at Goleta Valley Hospital located at 351 South Patterson, Santa Barbara.**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/df/Lab_Rules_-_4.1_map_to_cottage_hospital.png/489px-Lab_Rules_-_4.1_map_to_cottage_hospital.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_4.1_map_to_cottage_hospital.png)
### **Emergency Showers/Eye Wash**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/10/Lab_Rules_-_4.2_eye_wash_and_shower.png/300px-Lab_Rules_-_4.2_eye_wash_and_shower.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_4.2_eye_wash_and_shower.png)
Emergency showers and eye wash stations are located at the south end of all bays. An enclosed emergency shower is located in Bay 5 beside the wet etch benches. There is a clean Nanofab gown in the shower and tubes of calcium gluconate for any HF exposure. A first aid kit is located in the gowning room, and on the south wall (towards 
the windows) at the end of bays 2, 4, and 6. 
### **AED (automated external defibrillator)**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/c4/Lab_Rules_-_4.3_AED.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_4.3_AED.png)
There is an AED (automated external defibrillator) in the gowning room next to the entry door. It is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardiain apatient and is able to treat them through defibrillation, the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to reestablish an effective rhythm. This type of heart condition is commonly caused by electrical shock. The gowning room also has a CPR kit, first aid kit and ear plugs by the entry door. 
### **Chemical Spills**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/5/58/Lab_Rules_-_4.4_supplies_rack_chemical_spill_cleanup.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_4.4_supplies_rack_chemical_spill_cleanup.png)
**If unsure, Always assume a liquid on the floor could be a hazardous chemical. Always verify the pH of an unknown floor spill with the pH strips stocked on the wire racks in bays containing wet chemistry.**
For small spills, use the appropriate chemical spill clean-up kit, yellow hazardous bag and EH&S tags, place bag into chemical waste storage cabinet located in service chase 5. Chemical spill clean-up kits and yellow hazardous bags are located on the wire shelving in each bay containing a wet bench. After using a spill cleanup kit, please inform the Nanofab staff. For large spills, immediately contact the Nanofab staff and evacuate people from the area. If off hours, please remain at Nanofab entrance until on call staff arrive and prevent users from entering the Nanofab 
### **Lab Fire**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/ce/Lab_Rules_-_4.5_fire_extinguisher.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_4.5_fire_extinguisher.png)
In the case that a lab fire arises at any bench or piece of equipment, immediately hit the Emergency Power Off (EPO) button for the bench/equipment. You may then grab a fire extinguisher and put out the small fire. Halotron fire extinguishers are located on the south end of each clean bay, and the north end of each maintenance chase. Halotron is rated as an ABC extinguisher. It is used on electronic equipment because it leaves no residue. You are not required to extinguish a fire, but if you are confident and have been trained in the use of a fire extinguisher, then it is a subjective decision to fight a small fire. If in doubt, hit the emergency off for the affected bench or equipment, immediately pull fire alarm and exit building. Please review the first floor Nanofab/Engineering Science Building evacuation map below. 
### **For emergencies after hours**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/2/2f/Lab_Rules_-_4.6_after_hours_contact_sign.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_4.6_after_hours_contact_sign.png)
Contact the Nanofab cell phone (**[**) for non-injury producing events, but not for simple equipment failures or issues. The cell phone number is also posted under the clocks at the end of each Bay. You can dial 911 from you cell phone or dial 9-911 from all Nanofab phones for life threatening emergencies. The campus phone will connect you directly to UCSB Police Dispatch. Remember, dialing 911 on your personal cell phone connects you to a county dispatch and not a campus dispatch so you will need to give them location information. The campus dispatch will know by the campus phone number where you are located on campus. 
### **UCSB NanoFab Exit Map**
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/d/dd/Lab_Rules_-_4.7_exit_map.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_4.7_exit_map.png)
## **HF/TMAH exposure**
### HF Exposure to Skin
  1. [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/3/30/Lab_Rules_-_5.1.1_HF_exposure_response_calgonate.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_5.1.1_HF_exposure_response_calgonate.png)Immediately rinse exposed area for 15 minutes in safety shower, flush affected area thoroughly. Speed and thoroughness in washing off the acid is of primary importance. An enclosed emergency shower is located in bay 5 across from the HF wet etch bench. Remember, do not touch the exposed area with your bare hands. 
  2. Immediately after rinsing, start massaging 2.5% calcium gluconate gel into the affected. The individual applying the gel should wear gloves. Apply gel frequently and massage continuously. Calcium gluconate gel is located to the left of the HF bench in a pocket mounted to the side of the bench and at the shower stall in Bay 5. 
  3. Take the victim to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital emergency room. Call 9-911 from Nanofab phones for transport by ambulance if necessary. 
  4. Continue rubbing gel on affected area until advised otherwise by physician. 


### HF Exposure to Eyes
  1. Immediately rinse exposed area for 15 minutes at eye wash station. Hold eyelids open during irrigation to allow thorough flushing of the eyes. Water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK. 
  2. Take victim to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital emergency room. Call 9- 911 from Nanofab phones for transport by ambulance if necessary. 


### **TetraMethyl Ammonium Hydroxide (TMAH) Exposure**
TMAH is a component in several photoresist developers and strippers, and is also used in the Nanofab as an ebeam resist developer and silicon etchant. The concentration of TMAH in photoresist developer and stripper solutions is relatively low (2-4%). However, the HSQ ebeam resist developer and silicon etchant utilize a solution of 25% TMAH. 
#### TMAH Exposure to Skin, 25% Concentration
Immediately rinse exposed area for at least 15 minutes in safety shower, flush affected area thoroughly. An enclosed emergency showers is located in bay 5 across from the HF/TMAH wet etch bench. If using the emergency shower at the end of the bay, water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK. 
  1. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911 from Nanofab phones. 


#### TMAH Exposure to Skin, 2%-4%Concentration
  1. If small area skin exposure (<1% body surface area, <approximately 25 inches2) to 2-4% TMAH, immediately rinse exposed area until skin feels normal (not greasy). If irritation occurs, consult a physician. 
  2. If medium to large area skin exposure (>1% body surface area, >approximately 25 inches2) to 2-4% TMAH, immediately rinse exposed area for at least 15 minutes in safety shower, flush affected area thoroughly. An enclosed emergency shower is located in bay 5 across from the HF/TMAH wet bench. If using the emergency shower at the end of the bay, water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911 from Nanofab phones or using your cell phone to dial 911. 


#### TMAH Exposure to Eyes, Any Concentration
  1. Immediately rinse exposed area for at least 15 minutes at eye wash station. Hold eyelids open during irrigation to allow thorough flushing of the eyes. Water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK. 
  2. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911 from Nanofab phones or using your cell phone to dial 911 


## Pregnancy and the Nanofab
The effects on a fetus of many of the chemicals utilized in the Nanofab is unknown. The Nanofab is designed to prevent exposure to the fumes and vapors from these chemicals, but absolute 100% containment is impossible, and it is possible to be exposed to extremely small concentrations of these materials. Consequently, we strongly recommend that you do not work in the Nanofab if you know or suspect that you are pregnant. 
## Chemicals in the Nanofab
### General Information and the SDS (or MSDS)
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/7/70/Lab_Rules_-_7.1_MSDS_binders.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.1_MSDS_binders.png)
All chemicals, compounds, gases, materials for evaporation, etc., must be approved by the Nanofab manager before introduction into the facility. In order to introduce a new material into the Nanofab, a SDS (Safety Data Sheet) for the material in .pdf format must be submitted to the Nanofab manager, along with any anticipated processes involving the new material. The SDS contains safety information regarding exposure, first aid, handling, storage, fire hazard, other chemical incompatibilities, etc., for all chemicals, gases, and materials present in the facility. Before using an unfamiliar material, consult the SDS to determine any potential hazards. Consult the SDS to determine the proper course of action if someone has been exposed to a gas or chemical, or a spill has occurred. Binders containing the SDS for any material used in the Nanofab is located just inside the gowning room. Additionally, an electronic version of the (M)SDS in .pdf format for all chemicals in our inventory is located on our wiki page. Quick google searches on internet connected devices can also bring up SDS’s rather quickly. 
All users are expected to read and understand the SDS (Safety Data Sheets) for all chemicals they use in the facility, even if the usage or process has been passed down from previous group members. Users that understand the dangers and incompatibilities of the chemicals they work with are safer users. Users should also understand how to mix chemicals properly to avoid potential exothermic reactions. It is the responsibility of the user and their PI to make sure chemicals are mixed and used in a safe manner and that proper PPE is worn for the chemicals being used. Users may contact the facility management for guidance if unsure of proper chemical use and handling for given chemicals. 
### Containers and Labeling
  1. Chemical containers such as beakers, bottles, etc., must be labeled with **contents, date, and ownership (individual or group name)**. This information can be written on a wipe under the container. **Noncompliance of this policy can result in lab suspension.**
    1. **ALL Containers** containing any liquids must be **labelled** at **ALL TIMES, even if you are standing next to the container. No exceptions.**
    2. A beaker in use on a solvent bench can contain acetone, propanol, or methanol if the beaker is labeled with the text: “acetone/propanol/methanol”. The generic label “solvent” is insufficient. Beakers containing solvents other that acetone, propanol, or methanol must be labeled with the specific solvent. 
    3. Beakers in use at lithography developer benches must be labeled with exact contents and ownership (individual or group name). The generic label “developer” is insufficient. 
    4. “Acid” or “Base” is insufficient as a label. You must have the chemical name. Common names of user-mixed chemical mixtures such as “Aqua-Regia”, “RCA-2”, “Piranha” are also insufficient. Mixtures must be properly labeled such as “Sulfuric Acid: Hydrogen Peroxide” or “Hydrochloric Acid: Nitric Acid” when mixed by users. Premixed chemicals poured from manufacturer bottles may be labeled as on the bottle. “Gold-Etchant – Type TFA” or “Al-Etchant Type D”, or “Nanostrip” etc. are acceptable for chemical designation. 


#### Chemical compatibility with containers
  1. Most chemicals are compatible with glass (Pyrex, fused silicas, or quartz) containers. Compatibility with various forms of plastic are determined on a case by case basis using chemical compatibility charts available on various websites. 
  2. HF: Glass beakers are not compatible with HF containing acids. Use PTFE, Nalgene, or other forms of Teflon-like materials. 


#### Transporting Chemicals from bench to bench
  1. Users may not transport open containers of chemicals from bench to bench. This is an unsafe practice and there are no exceptions, including water.
  2. In order to transfer containers with chemicals from bench to bench when there is not another alternative, you may do the following: 
    1. Get a large HDPE sealable plastic tub and place it in the bench.
    2. Place your beaker (or other open container) in the tub
    3. Put lid on and snap shut the lid so that it is secure.
    4. Transport the enclosed bin to the other bench.
    5. Place in hood, open lid, remove chemical, place empty bin under the bench.
    6. Use the same procedure for transporting large water beakers to the etchers (for water soaks after etch) and back to the benches for draining.


### Chemical Storage
If you are approved to bring in a new material, the lab manager will instruct you to where you are allowed to use the chemistry and to store your material. You are not allowed to store any chemicals in your personal blue bins. All chemicals must be stored in approved locations. The general rules are as follows: 
#### Using Chemicals
Common sense dictates that you select the opened bottle of any necessary chemistry first that you need to use. This will minimize waste and possible contamination of the stored chemistry. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/3c/Lab_Rules_-_7.3_acid_cabinet.png/132px-Lab_Rules_-_7.3_acid_cabinet.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.3_acid_cabinet.png)
#### Acid Storage
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/59/Lab_Rules_-_7.3.2_base_cabinet.png/137px-Lab_Rules_-_7.3.2_base_cabinet.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.3.2_base_cabinet.png)
The primary acid storage area (except HF) is the located next to the acid wet processing benches in bay 5. HF acid is stored in the HF cabinet in Bay 5. Some materials are placed in bins (or on particular shelves) within the cabinet to keep any spill physically separated from other incompatible, but acidic, materials that may also be stored in the same cabinet. Users must store the acids in the proper designated places as directed by the staff. 
#### Base Storage
The primary base storage area is the base cabinet located next to the acid wet processing bench in Bay 5. Some materials are placed in bins (or on particular shelves) within the cabinet to keep any spill physically separated from other incompatible, but caustic, materials that may also be stored in the same cabinet. Users must store the bases in the proper designated places as directed by the staff. 
[![Solvent and Photoresist Storage](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8c/Lab_Rules_-_7.3.4_Solvent_%2B_PR_storage.png/163px-Lab_Rules_-_7.3.4_Solvent_%2B_PR_storage.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.3.4_Solvent_%2B_PR_storage.png)Solvent and Photoresist Storage
#### Solvent Storage
The primary solvent storage area is the stainless steel flammables cabinet in Bay 6. You may store small amounts of solvents in labeled containers on the shelves in the photolith area. Other unique solvents should be stored in the User Solvent cabinet in service chase 6. If too many small user bottles are being stored on shelves in the benches, the staff may announce a cleanup and “reset” the benches as a means of keeping the benches in order. 
#### Photoresist Storage
Photoresist can contain many solvents and aromatics that are potentially toxic. Special care must be exercised when handling these materials. All photoresist fumes must be exhausted or otherwise contained through careful procedures at the photolith wet benches. The primary photoresist storage area is the lab refrigerator located in Bay 6. The few resists that do not need refrigeration are stored in the spinner benches on the back shelf (PMGI, PMMA, etc.). 
##### Transfer to Small(Personal) Bottles
Small brown bottles of various sizes are provided to you on the wire racks. Transfer resist from the main bottle to your small bottle while the resist is cold. Do not let the main resist bottle warm up. You do not need to worry about condensation when transferring resist from the cold bottle to your container as we have set the refrigerator temp to be above the normal dew point (~10C) for the Nanofab. If you see any condensation forming on the bottles please inform the Nanofab staff. Large transfer pipettes are provided for transferring PR from the main bottle to your in-use bottle. To prevent PR flakes from contaminating the main bottle, please inspect the main bottle cap and bottle threads for PR, and remove any PR with EBR and a wipe before replacing cap. After transfer, place main bottle back in the refrigerator. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/ca/Lab_Rules_-_7.3.5.2_PR_Cabinet.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.3.5.2_PR_Cabinet.png)
##### Small (Personal) Bottle Storage
You may store your in-use, fully labeled PR bottle in the stainless steel PR storage cabinet in a bin labeled with your research group name (shown). Disposable droppers, syringes, and filters are provided for the application of photoresist on your substrate. You may store photoresist in the PR storage cabinet for a maximum of 12 months. Nanofab staff will remove in-use PR bottles older than 12 months, and will also remove any bottle not correctly labeled with contents, date, and ownership. 
#### Materials needing refrigeration
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/e/e2/Lab_Rules_-_7.3.6_refrigerators.png/191px-Lab_Rules_-_7.3.6_refrigerators.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.3.6_refrigerators.png)
There are two refrigerators in the Nanofab for resist/chemical storage. The main refrigerator in Bay 6 is set at ~10C and most of the resists are stored. There is a small freezer in service chase 5 that is set at -20C for lower temp storage needs. 
### Solvent Processing
**Solvents with flashpoints below 55C° cannot be heated in the Nanofab.** This includes acetone, methanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and toluene. All solvent processing is limited to the stainless steel solvent processing benches. Do not perform standard solvent processing at the photoresist spinner benches. The only solvent allowed at the PR spinner benches is EBR100 (PGMEA). **Do not cover the holes on the fronts of the benches with wipes as this will disrupt the exhaust resulting in fumes escaping the bench.**
### Acid/Base and HF/TMAH/Bromine Processing
You may not deviate from these policies unless you have prior approval by the Nanofab manager. 
  1. All wet processing involving acids and bases (**except HF or any mixture including HF, Bromine, TMAH >5%, and developers**) is limited to the acid/base benches. Do not bring acids/bases to the solvent stainless-steel benches. 
  2. All HF, TMAH >5%, and Bromine-based processing is limited to the two HF/TMAH wet benches in bay 5 and wet bench in bay 4 - NO EXCEPTIONS. Store all HF, TMAH >5%, and bromine in labeled containers in the HF acid/bromine storage cabinet. Please keep open containers of these toxic chemicals away from the edge of the bench. Waste solutions containing HF and TMAH are poured down the drain, and treated in the Nanofab acid treatment system. Empty HF and concentrated TMAH bottles should be returned to the HF acid storage cabinet.[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/89/Lab_Rules_-_7.5.3_acid_benches_PPE.png/194px-Lab_Rules_-_7.5.3_acid_benches_PPE.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.5.3_acid_benches_PPE.png)
  3. Personal Protective Equipment: When working at any HF/TMAH bench (bay 4 and bay 5) always wear: 
    1. **fully-sleeved chemical apron,**
    2. **face shield, and**
    3. **“TRIonic E-194” (Nitrile/Neoprene/Latex Blend) thicker gloves.**
  4. When working with other acids/bases at the benches, use appropriate PPE based on the materials being used by you or others at the bench. Full gowning and face-shields are recommended for heated or high concentration acid processing, especially piranha. 
  5. Always keep your face above the sash as much as possible to minimize exposure to the head in case of an accident. **Do not cover the holes on the fronts of the benches** with wipes as this will disrupt the exhaust resulting in fumes escaping the bench. 
  6. **Do not use wipes in the sinks**. Wipes cause many issues in the sinks. They are not needed in the sinks. Do not leave broken glass in the sink. If glassware is broken in the sink, the nanofab staff can assist in cleanup. Do not ignore a clogged sink. If a drain is clogged, promptly report this to the nanofab staff using the nanofab@ece.ucsb.eduemail address. 


### Photoresist Coating or Spinning
  1. Standard solvent-based photoresist spinning should be performed at the PR spinner benches. Some lithography chemicals utilize non-standard chemicals in place of solvents, which may require spinning at a different bench. If using non-standard lithography chemicals, please provide the (M)SDS and process instructions to the Nanofab manager for direction in this matter. Spin-coaters have standard recipes 2-9 programmed into all units. **Do not change these recipes**. Recipes 0 and 1 can be changed at will for user-defined spincoat processes. A variety of spin-coating chucks are provided by the facility. Use a chuck appropriate for the sample size you are using. Make sure chuck surfaces are clean when done. Do not remove the O-ring from the chuck. If you need a specialized chuck, please discuss with the Nanofab staff. Unless you purchased the chuck separately for your research group, **all chucks are the property of the Nanofab and may not be taken and placed in your box for your own personal use. Non-compliance of this policy can result in lab suspension.**[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/7/7f/Lab_Rules_-_7.6.2_spin_bowl_liners_on_racks.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.6.2_spin_bowl_liners_on_racks.png)
  2. Spin Bowl Liners: Use two large orange backed wipes to line the bowl before spinning resist. Place them at 45 degrees relative to each other so that wipes cover the maximum amount of bowl area. If the wipe is saturated with resist, remove the top wipe and place in the beaker at the back of the bench after you are done with your coating process. NEVER place/dispose of the spin bowl liners or any other resist coated material into the regular trash or other non-exhausted area.
  3. Adhesion Promoters: HMDS is commonly used as an adhesion promoter. Samples can be soaked in HMDS on the spinner chuck and then spun dry. Residual HMDS vapor can interact with resist and inhibit development, so it is recommended to either replace the wipe in the bowl after HMDS or to use the nitrogen gun to dry residuals from the liner wipes before spin coating the resist. 


### Developer Benches
  1. Developer benches are used for developing photoresists only using Hydroxide-based developers such as AZ400K or MIF developers. In general, solvents are not allowed at the developer benches because solvent fumes adversely affect the develop process. Solvent based liftoff processes are not allowed at the developer benches. E-beam lithography development processes that utilize solvents such as MIBK and IPA should be performed at the solvent benches in the photolith area. If you are unsure of where you should develop wafers, contact the lab management. 


### Cyanide-based processing
**All compounds containing cyanide needs to be approved for use by the lab management. These materials are typically used only at the stainless steel solvent bench in Bay 5, where no acids are allowed. Never bring cyanide-based compounds to the acid bench. All waste is collected and stored in a designated cabinet. A procedure for use will be determined by the lab manager upon each request.**
### Photoresist Handling, and Waste
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/bb/Lab_Rules_-_7.9_PR_spinner.png/111px-Lab_Rules_-_7.9_PR_spinner.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.9_PR_spinner.png)
Photoresist can contain many solvents and aromatics that are potentially toxic. Special care must be exercised when handling these materials. All photoresist fumes must be exhausted or otherwise contained through careful procedures at the photolith wet benches. Disposable droppers, syringes, and filters are provided for the application of photoresist on your substrate. Nanofab wipes and pipettes contaminated with PR must be placed in the provided beaker containers at the back of the spinner benches. Do not place PR contaminated materials in the trashcans, as this will allow photoresist fumes to migrate throughout the photolith area. Dispose of waste photoresist bottles by placing your labeled bottle in the yellow solvent waste cabinet at the North end of chase 5. 
### Photoresist Strippers
Use of heated photoresist strippers (such as NMP) is limited to the stainless steel solvent benches. It is recommended you use the heated water bath to heat your stripper to 80 C. If you choose to use a hot plate to heat commercial photoresist strippers, you may use a maximum hot plate temperature 80 C, even though the liquid will not reach the plate temperature. You may place a small amount of water under your glass container to facilitate heat transfer. Again, you may never use a hot plate above 80C at any time while heating PR strippers in the Nanofab. 
### Powders and Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles and powders present unique challenges. In general, all nanoparticles and powders must be in solution before bringing into the nanofab. Any user needing to use nanoparticles or powders must discuss this with the operational director before using in the facility. (M)SDS sheets for bulk materials are not sufficient regarding the dangers of nanoparticles of the same material type. 
### Chemical Waste Disposal
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/6/6e/Lab_Rules_-_7.12.1_chemical_storage-disposal_sheet.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.12.1_chemical_storage-disposal_sheet.png)
#### General Guidelines
  1. The correct method of disposal for any chemical waste in our inventory is posted throughout the Nanofab on the sides of the benches. 
  2. **DO NOT DISPOSE OF** **SOLVENTS IN THE ACID DRAIN,** **OR** **ACIDS AND BASES IN THE SOLVENT DRAINS** **DUE TO** **POSSIBLE EXPLOSION OR THE CREATION OF OTHER HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS.** If you are unsure about any chemical disposal procedure, please contact the nanofab staff to discuss.


#### Methods of Chemical Disposal
All chemical waste is disposed of in one of three methods: 
##### Acid drains
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/88/Lab_Rules_-_7.12.2.1_developer_drain_and_lift_station.png/300px-Lab_Rules_-_7.12.2.1_developer_drain_and_lift_station.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.12.2.1_developer_drain_and_lift_station.png)
Most (but not all) water-based chemicals use this method. All liquid waste from the plastic benches is collected in pump lift stations behind the benches in the service chases. These lift stations pump the waste chemicals overhead to an acid waste neutralization (AWN) system located outside of the Nanofab in the mechanical room where the chemical waste is treated for pH and then drained to the sewer. This is the primary drain in the Nanofab. All liquids entering the sink drain at any polypropylene wet bench in the Nanofab run through this treatment system. To dispose of an acid or base, pour the liquid down the drain, rinse and drain glassware 3 times, use the sprayer to dilute the mixture in the sink while draining, and use the plenum flush to help dilute/rinse the chemical into the lift stations (especially for concentrated acid mixtures). There are also venturi aspirators at the 
back of all acid/base benches to pump the chemistry from larger beakers so that you do not have to pick them up and pour them in to the sinks. When using this technique, always use the plenum flush and rinse your beakers when done. **Do not pour the liquid thru the perforated tops**. If you spill an acid or base onto the top surface of a bench, first rinse the surface thoroughly with water using the DI sprayers, then turn on the plenum flush to rinse the bench drain. **Do not pour solvents down the acid drain**. 
##### Solvent dumps
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/f9/Lab_Rules_-_7.12.2.2_solvent_drain_and_lift_station.png/300px-Lab_Rules_-_7.12.2.2_solvent_drain_and_lift_station.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.12.2.2_solvent_drain_and_lift_station.png)
Waste solvents are poured into the solvent dumps at the back of each solvent bench. Most (but not all) solvent waste uses this method. **Do not pour the liquid thru the perforated tops.Do not pour waste over the POLOS spinners**. The solvent drain waste is collected in a pump lift station in the service chases. The lift stations pump when full to a storage tank located in the Nanofab mechanical room. The waste solvents are transported to the EH&S chemical waste processing facility and are properly disposed. **Do not use acids or bases at the solvent benches**. 
##### Collection of chemical waste
Some chemicals require collection according to state regulations. When this is the case, always fill out the Environmental Health and Safety waste disposal tags that are provided at the waste cabinet in service chase 5. Fill out each tag with the appropriate information when disposing of collected chemical waste. EH&S will only remove properly labeled waste bags and containers. Nanofab staff can assist with this process. 
#### Disposing of Empty Acid, Base, and Solvent Bottles
All chemical storage cabinets have a shelf labeled for empty containers. Place empty containers in the respective cabinet. Do not rinse any empty chemical containers. Nanofab staff will collect all empty bottles from the cabinets and properly rinse and dispose into the trash. 
## Nanofab Apparel and Gloves
### Bunnysuits and Booties
  1. You must wear a full bunnysuit to enter the Nanofab (hood, gown, shoe covers). Facial covers are optional. Change bunnysuits weekly if used often, or at least once a month if used sporadically. There is a laundry window by the glove rack where all dirty cleanroom gowns, hoods and booties should be placed. 
  2. Sandals or any other open toed shoes are not allowed in the Nanofab at any time. The only protection to your feet are provided by the closed toe shoes you are wearing under the booties. Shorts are allowed under bunny suits, but long pants are better.[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/8/85/Lab_Rules_-_6.1.3_hangar_reservation_sheet.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_6.1.3_hangar_reservation_sheet.png)
  3. Store gowns and hoods on the numbered hangers in the gowning room. Store booties in the corresponding numbered slot in the bootie storage rack. **You must then clearly write your name on the hanger reservation** list posted on the wall where the safety glasses are stored in the gowning room. Please follow these simple instructions. Gown use and laundering directly affects your recharge rates. Abuse of this system is a sad waste of money on facility cost than research investment. **Failure to comply with this policy will result in your gown being removed and possible suspension from the lab**. 


### Eye Protection
ANSI-approved eye protection must be worn at all times in the Nanofab, except when using optical microscopes. All eye protection eyewear must be ANSI-approved, as indicated by the “Z87” stamp required on the eyewear. You are welcome to use personal prescription safety eyewear which is ANSI-approved. Three types of safety eyewear are stocked in the Nanofab: 
  1. Safety glasses used by people who do not wear vision correction glasses. 
  2. Safety glasses used for use by people who do wear vision correction glasses. These safety glasses are intended to be worn over vision correction glasses. 
  3. U.S. Safety Faceshield. The full faceshields must be worn when working with dangerous chemicals or materials. **You should always try to keep the sash between your face and the chemistry in the bench.** Remember it is not just your chemistry, but other user’s chemistry at the bench could cause a hazard. Any time your face is below the sash of a wet bench a safety faceshield should be worn. It is mandatory to wear a faceshield when working at the HF/TMAH bench. 
  4. **Failure to have on appropriate eye protection is a clear violation of the PPE policy and will result in lab suspension.**


### Aprons and Gloves
#### General Information
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/6/61/Lab_Rules_-_6.3.1.4_glove_racks.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_6.3.1.4_glove_racks.png)Glove racks in gowning room and throughout the 'fab.
**Always wear gloves when in the Nanofab**. Gloves are intended to protect you from chemistry when the appropriate glove is used and to protect equipment (vacuum systems, table tops, etc.) from contamination from your skin. Acid aprons are 
required when handling HF/TMAH and other highly corrosive or toxic chemicals. It is acceptable to wear an apron at any of the acid/base benches. 
  1. You are not allowed to walk from one bay to another or use any lab equipment while gowned in the acid aprons, face shield or Trionic gloves used at the acid/base benches. This is to prevent possible chemical contamination of other equipment/areas in the lab. You must remove these items when leaving the acid/base/HF/TMAH wet bench areas of bays 4 or 5. 
  2. There are many manufacturer on-line websites listing chemical resistance of gloves. Please check these guidelines and the SDS when selecting proper glove for a particular chemical. 
  3. **Five types of gloves are available in the Nanofab:**

**Material** |  **Model** |  **Color** |  **Thickness** |  **Sizes**  
---|---|---|---|---  
PVC  | Kimtech G5 Co-Polymer  | Clear  | 0.1mm (4mil)  | S, M, L, XL   
Latex  | Kimtech G3 Latex  | Tan  | 0.2mm (8mil)  | 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 10   
Nitrile  | Best CleaN-Dex Ultimate  | White  | 0.15mm (6mil)  | XS, S, M, L, XL   
Nitrile  | MAPA StanSolve A-30  | Green  | 0.28mm (11mil)  | 7, 8, 9, 10, 11   
Blend  | MAPA TRIonic E-194  | Tan  | 0.5mm (20mil)  | 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11   
##### Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC): Kimtech G5 Co-Polymer
A relatively inexpensive static free general-purpose glove, poor for most organics. These gloves break down rapidly in acetone. 
##### Latex: Kimtech G3 Latex
A general-purpose glove, poor for most organics, okay with aldehydes and keytones. 
##### Nitrile, White: Best CleaN-Dex Ultimate
A thin general purpose low cost glove offers marginal protection from many keytones, okay with some acids and bases. 
##### Nitrile, Green: MAPA StanSolve A-30
A thicker nitrile glove that affords increased protection over the CleaN-Dex white nitrile glove. 
##### Nitrile/Neoprene/Latex Blend: MAPA TRIonic E-194
The glove is the standard wet processing glove. A blend of latex, neoprene, and carboxylated nitrile, which offers excellent protection from corrosives and solvents such as HF and acetone. Highly resistant to cuts, tears, and snags. Always use this glove when processing with HF, TMAH, or Bromine. 
## Communications and Internet Access
The basic approach to lab communications is that the Nanofab staff/management must be able to contact every user of the lab. All user emails and phone numbers must be current. **If the Nanofab can’t communicate with you then you can’t enter/use the lab.** Most of our systems will automatically remove you from the lab if your email bounces. If that happens then your access will be shut off to enter the lab. **This is the user’s responsibility to make sure the contact info is correct and up to date**. 
### Process Equipment Scheduling
The majority of the processing tools in the Nanofab are scheduled through a web-based equipment scheduling system known as “**signup monkey** ”. Anyone with Nanofab access can view the site, but only users who have completed training on a tool will be able to schedule use of that tool. The site address is: 
<http://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu>. Once you have been trained by the specific staff engineer in charge of a system then you will be able to reserve time on the tool through signupmonkey. 
There is more information about the system on our wiki page: [https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Main_Page.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Main_Page ""Main Page"")
  1. **Script writing for tool sign-up is forbidden**. **Users caught trying to run scripts will be suspended from the cleanroom without exception.**
  2. Users must sign up for all tools on signup monkey before use. The only exception is when another user did not show up for their timeslot and you take it**.**
  3. Only trained/authorized users may operate process equipment. The tool owner is responsible for this training. **Users will be suspended without exception for using equipment they are not authorized to use**. 

[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/7/7e/Lab_Rules_-_7.2_signupmonkey.png/484px-Lab_Rules_-_7.2_signupmonkey.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.2_signupmonkey.png)SignupMonkey, the online tool reservation system.
### Saving Data in the NanoFab
The Nanofab does not allow USB memory sticks for saving electronic files. USB ports are disabled on most computers to prevent the spread of viruses. Instead, you can download your files from our SFTP server, Nanofiles. As long as you place your files into the proper folder on the computer, your files will be synced to the **Nanofiles STFP server** every hour (or immediately by running the ""_Sync to NanoFiles_ "" script). For instructions on how to access these files, and where to place your files, please log into your **SignupMonkey** account and click the “here” link under **Files** on the front page as shown below. The email you receive will give you instructions on accessing/syncing to the **Nanofiles server**. 
### Cell phone and Laptops
It is fine to bring in your cell phones and laptops into the Nanofab. You need to clean your laptops and cellphones with ISO or ISO/Water before bringing them into the cleanroom. 
### Earbuds
You can use earbuds in the lab to listen to whatever you want. **But it is your responsibility to make sure you can also hear other users or staff at all times**. This is a clear safety issue if not followed. The use of earbuds is a privilege, not a necessity. **Please do not abuse this policy as it can be removed. Willful non-compliance will result in a lab suspension**. 
### Global Nanofab email List
All Nanofab users will be entered into our cleanroom@ece.ucsb.edu mail list. This is how the Nanofab staff/management will communicate with all users of the lab. 
It is critical and **_required that you read all these emails_** as there will be important updates/announcements about lab policy, lab closures and any major lab events occurring. 
### User Responsibility for Receiving Communications
**It is the users’ responsibility to make sure they are receiving emails from both cleanroom@ece.ucsb.eduand our signupmonkey**. You must check with your IT people to make sure these emails are allowed and not placed in spam or denied from your emails. It is mandatory you receive and read all these emails. 
### Contact Nanofab Staff
You can contact staff through their individual email addresses or phones numbers. Or you can send an email to nanofab@ece.ucsb.edu which will contact all Nanofab staff. The appropriate staff will answer your email request. 
### Synchronized Clocks
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/0/05/Lab_Rules_-_7.8_clock_%2B_after_hours_contact.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Lab_Rules_-_7.8_clock_%2B_after_hours_contact.png)
At the south end of all Nanofab bays are large digital clock displays mounted high on the south wall. These clocks are synchronized to one time and can be used as a timer for process. Contact Nanofab staff if they are not in sync. The emergency cell phone number is also displayed below these clocks. 
### Wireless Access in the Nanofab and on campus
All registered users should have a UCSBNetID to access the network. Repeaters are used within the facility to boost the signals. 
#### UCSB Secure
  1. Everyone with a UCSBNetID can access this network. 


#### Eduroam (recommended)
  1. Everyone with a UCSBNetID can access this network.


#### UCSB Wireless Web (not recommended)
  1. This wireless connection is open to anyone, but has very limited speeds and will not auto connect so you need to constantly log in and out. 


## Nanofab Summer Intern Policy
### **Whenever the intern is in the Nanofab, the mentor must also be in the Nanofab.**
Interns may use tools that do not require training sessions, such as microscopes, etc, unless the supervisor of these tools objects. Interns can work at photolith benches, and use components of the photolith benches, unless the supervisor of the bench objects. Interns will need to follow normal Nanofab access procedures, including orientation meeting with the Nanofab manager. 
### Tool Usage by Interns
Interns will be allowed to use a limited number of mainline Nanofab tools after completing training conducted by Nanofab staff. Mainline tools are tools scheduled through our web site signupmonkey. Certain tools may be unavailable to interns due to extremely heavy use or other concerns. 
### Rates for Interns
Summer interns will be charged a lower subsidized rate for use during the course of their internship. These rates are set each year. Please contact the lab director for more information.

# General Nanofabrication Facility Safety Policies
## Visual and Audible Alarms in the Nanofab
  1. **Fire Alarm** : White strobe with high volume audible alarm, located throughout the Nanofab. If this alarm activates, immediately leave the Nanofab through the nearest exit. Do not remove bunnysuit until outside.
  2. **Toxic Gas Alarm** : Blue strobe with high volume audible alarm, located at both ends of each bay. If this alarm activates in one bay, do not enter the bay. If this alarm activates throughout the Nanofab, immediately leave the Nanofab through the nearest exit. Do not remove bunnysuit until outside.
  3. **Wet Bench Alarms** : Small illuminated visual alarms with buzzers. Each wet bench may have multiple alarms, with a placard beside the alarms indicating meaning of alarm and proper response. You must follow proper response if you see or hear a wet bench alarm.
  4. **Equipment Alarms** : Please notify supervisor of tool if equipment alarm is activated.


## Emergencies and First Aid
If you believe you may have been exposed to a toxic substance or gas, if appropriate rinse in the emergency shower. In all cases, quickly go to the emergency room at Goleta Valley Hospital. 
Emergency showers and eye wash stations are located at the south end of all bays. An enclosed emergency showers is located in bay 5 beside the wet etch benches. 
A first aid kit is located in the gowning room, and on the south wall at the end of bays 2, 4, and 6. 
Chemical spill clean-up kits are located on the wire shelving in each bay containing a wet bench. After using a spill cleanup kit, please inform the Nanofab manager. 
Fire extinguishers are located on the south end of each clean bay, and the north end of each maintenance chase. 
## Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) Exposure
### HF Exposure to Skin
  1. Immediately rinse exposed area for 5 minutes in safety shower, flush affected area thoroughly. Speed and thoroughness in washing off the acid is of primary importance. An enclosed emergency showers is located in bay 5 across from the HF/TMAH wet processing bench. If using the emergency shower at the end of the bay, water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK.
  2. Immediately after rinsing, start massaging 2.5% calcium gluconate gel into the affected area. The individual applying the gel should wear gloves. Apply gel frequently and massage continuously. Calcium gluconate gel is located to the left of the HF bench in a pocket mounted to the side of the bench.
  3. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911.
  4. Continue rubbing gel on affected area until advised otherwise by physician.


### HF Exposure to Eyes
  1. Immediately rinse exposed area for 15 minutes at eye wash station. Hold eyelids open during irrigation to allow thorough flushing of the eyes. Water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK.
  2. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911.


## TetraMethylAmmonium Hydroxide (TMAH) Exposure
TMAH is a component in several photoresist developers and strippers, and is also used in the Nanofab as an ebeam resist developer and silicon etchant. The concentration of TMAH in photoresist developer and stripper solutions is relatively low (2-4%). However, the ebeam developer and silicon etchant utilize a solution of 25% TMAH. 
### TMAH Exposure to Skin, 25% Concentration
  1. Immediately rinse exposed area for at least 15 minutes in safety shower, flush affected area thoroughly. An enclosed emergency showers is located in bay 5 across from the HF/TMAH wet etch bench. If using the emergency shower at the end of the bay, water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK.
  2. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911


### TMAH Exposure to Skin, 2%-4%Concentration
  1. If small area skin exposure (<1% body surface area, <approximately 25 inches2) to 2-4% TMAH, immediately rinse exposed area until skin feels normal (not greasy). If irritation occurs, consult a physician.
  2. If medium to large area skin exposure (>1% body surface area, >approximately 25 inches2) to 2-4% TMAH, immediately rinse exposed area for at least 15 minutes in safety shower, flush affected area thoroughly. An enclosed emergency showers is located in bay 5 across from the HF/TMAH wet etch bench. If using the emergency shower at the end of the bay, water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911.


### TMAH Exposure to Eyes, Any Concentration
  1. Immediately rinse exposed area for at least 15 minutes at eye wash station. Hold eyelids open during irrigation to allow thorough flushing of the eyes. Water will spill onto floor of Nanofab - this is OK.
  2. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 9-911


## Pregnancy and the Nanofab
The effects on a fetus of many of the chemicals utilized in the Nanfab is unknown. The Nanofab is designed to prevent exposure to the fumes and vapors from these chemicals, but absolute 100% containment is impossible, and it is possible to be exposed to extremely small concentrations of these materials. Consequently, we strongly recommend that you do not work in the Nanofab if you know or suspect that you are pregnant. 
# Chemicals and Hazardous Materials the Nanofab
## [MSDS](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MSDS ""MSDS"")
The MSDS contains safety information regarding exposure, first aid, handling, storage, fire hazard, etc., for all chemicals, gases, and materials present in the facility. Before using an unfamiliar material, consult the MSDS to determine any potential hazards. Consult the MSDS to determine the proper course of action if someone has been exposed to a gas or chemical, or a spill has occurred. A book containing the MSDS for any material used in the Nanofab is located just inside the gowning room. Additionally, an electronic version of the MDSD in .pdf format for all chemicals in our inventory is located on the desktops of all the computers connected to microscopes in the Nanofab. 
## Introducing New Materials Into the Nanofab
All new chemicals, compounds, gases, materials for evaporation, etc., must be approved by the Nanofab manager before introduction into the facility. In order to introduce a new material into the Nanofab, a MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for the material in .pdf format must be submitted to the Nanofab manager, plus a description of the proposed process utilizing the new material. The description of the process should include the goals of the process, and the mechanics of the process in reasonable detail. The Nanofab manager will determine if the material will be allowed in the Nanofab, and if so, where the new material will be stored, where the material is to be used (typically a specific wet bench), and how to dispose of the waste. 
## Containers and Labeling
Chemical containers such as beakers, bottles, etc, must be labeled with contents, date, and ownership (individual or group name). This information can be written on a wipe under the container. The exceptions to this policy are as follows: 
  1. A beaker in use on a solvent bench can contain acetone, propanol, or methanol if the beaker is labeled with the text: “acetone/propanol/methanol”. The generic label “solvent” is insufficient. Beakers containing solvents other that acetone, propanol, or methanol must be labeled with the specific solvent.
  2. Indication of date is no longer required on beakers in use on solvent benches. All beakers in use on solvent benches must be labeled with contents and ownership.
  3. Beakers in use at lithography developer benches must be labeled with exact contents and ownership (individual or group name). The generic label “developer” is insufficient.
  4. Indication of date is no longer required on beakers in use on the developer benches. All beakers in use on developer benches must be labeled with contents and ownership.


## Chemical Storage
  * **Acid Storage**

    The primary acid storage area (except HF) is the acid cabinet located next to the acid wet processing benches in bay 5. HF acid is stored in the HF cabinet
  * **Base Storage**

    The primary base storage area is the base cabinet located next to the acid wet processing bench.
  * **Solvent Storage**

    The primary solvent storage area is the stainless steel flammables cabinet in bay 6. You may store small amounts of solvents in labeled containers on the shelves in the photolith area.
## Solvent Processing
Solvents with flashpoints below 55 deg C cannot be heated in the Nanofab. This includes acetone, methanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and toluene. All solvent processing is limited to the stainless steel solvent processing benches. Do not perform standard solvent processing at the photoresist spinner benches. 
## Wet Etch and HF/TMAH Processing
All wet processing involving acids and bases (except HF and TMAH) is limited to the acid/base benches. All HF and Bromine processing is limited to the HF or HF/TMAH benches - NO EXCEPTIONS. All TMAH processing is limited to the HF/TMAH bench. When working at the HF or HF/TMAH benches, always wear a chemical apron, face shield, and “Trionic” gloves. Store all HF and bromine in labeled containers in the HF acid/bromine storage cabinet. Store TMAH is the base storage cabinet. Please keep open containers of these two toxic chemicals away from the edge of the bench. All waste solutions containing any HF is poured down the drain, and treated in the Nanofab acid treatment system. Empty HF bottles should be returned to the HF acid storage cabinet. You may not deviate from this policy unless you have prior approval by the Nanofab manager. 
## Photoresist Coating or Spinning
Standard solvent-based photoresist spinning should be perfomed at the PR spinner benches. Some lithography chemicals utilize non-standard chemicals in place of solvents, which may require spinning at a different bench. If using a non-standard lithography chemicals, please provide the MSDS and process instructions to the laboratory manager for direction in this matter. 
## Developer Benches
Developer benches are used for developing photoresists only. In general, solvents are not allowed at the developer benches because solvent fumes adversely affect the develop process. Solvent based liftoff processes are not allowed at the developer benches E-beam develop processes may utilize solvents, and should be performed at the solvent benches in the photolith area. 
## Plating Bench
The Solvent/Plating bench contains cyanide-based plating and etching solutions. Never use acid solutions at this bench. 
## Photoresist Storage, Handling, and Waste
Photoresists can contain many solvents and aromatics that are potentially toxic. Special care must be exercised when handling these materials. All photoresist fumes must be exhausted or otherwise contained through careful procedures at the photolith wet benches. The primary photoresist storage area is the lab refrigerator located bay 6. Some resists do not need refrigeration and are stored in the flammables cabinet next to the refrigerator (PMGI, PMMA, etc). Before transferring refrigerated PR from the main bottle to your in-use bottle, place main bottle on designated photoresist warming racks for a minimum of 2 hours, or until the bottle is at room temperature, whichever is longer. Large transfer pipettes are provided for transferring PR from the main bottle to your in-use bottle. To prevent PR flakes from contaminating the main bottle, please inspect the main bottle cap and bottle threads for PR, and remove any PR with an acetone wipe before replacing cap. After transfer, place main bottle back in the refrigerator. You may store your in-use, fully labeled PR bottle in the stainless steel PR storage cabinet in a bin labeled with your research group name. Disposable droppers, syringes, and filters are provided for the application of photoresist on your substrate. You may store photoresist in the PR storage cabinet for a maximum of 6 months. Nanofab staff will remove in-use PR bottles older than 6 months, and will also remove any bottle not correctly labeled with contents, date, and ownership. Nanofab wipes and pipettes contaminated with PR must be placed in the beakers at the back of the spinner benches. Do not place PR contaminated materials in the trashcans, as this will allow photoresist fumes to migrate throughout the photolith area. Dispose of waste photoresist bottles by placing your labeled bottle in the yellow solvent waste cabinet in chase 5. 
## Photoresist Strippers
Use of heated strippers is limited to the stainless steel solvent benches. It is recommended you use the heated water bath to heat your stripper to 80 C. If you choose to use a hot plate to heat commercial photoresist strippers, we realize the hot plate surface temperature will need to be set above 80 C. Ideally, you should use a temperature probe inserted in the liquid as the feedback control for the hot plate. If you have the hot plate surface temperature set above 80 C, you must actively monitor the temperature of the stripper using a thermometer (or equivalent) and limit the stripper temperature to a maximum of 80 degrees C. You must be in the vicinity of the hotplate whenever you are heating strippers with the hot plate surface set above 80 degrees C if you are not using a temperature probe for feedback control of the hot plate. **The following photoresist strippers are stocked:**
  * Shipley 1165
  * AZ 300T
  * Shipley SVC-14
  * PRX-127


## Chemical Waste Disposal
### General Guidelines
  1. The correct method of disposal for any chemical waste in our inventory is posted throughout the Nanofab, and also indicated in a file titled “Nanofab Chemical Storage/Use/Disposal”, located on the desktops of all optical microscope computers in the Nanofab.
  2. **DO NOT DISPOSE OF SOLVENTS IN THE ACID DRAIN, OR ACIDS AND BASES IN THE SOLVENT DRAINS DUE TO POSSIBLE EXPLOSION OR THE CREATION OF OTHER HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS.**


### All chemical waste is disposed in one of three methods:
**Acid Drains**     Most (but not all) water-based chemicals use this method. The acid drain empties into a waste chemical pH neutralization system located in the Nanofab mechanical room. This is the primary drain in the Nanofab. All liquids entering the sink drain at any polypropylene wet bench in the Nanofab run through this treatment system.     To dispose of an acid or base, pour the liquid down the drain using the plenum flush. If you spill an acid or base onto the top surface of a bench, first rinse the surface thoroughly with water, then turn on the plenum flush to rinse the bench drain. Do not pour solvents down the acid drain.
**Solvent Drains**     Most (but not all) solvent waste use this method. The solvent drain waste is pumped to a storage tank located in the Nanofab mechanical room. The waste solvents are transported to the EH&S chemical waste processing facility.
**Collection of Waste**     Always fill out the Environmental Health and Safety waste disposal form when storing waste chemicals in the appropriate cabinet.
## Disposing of Empty Acid, Base, and Solvent Bottles
Thoroughly rinse empty acid and base bottles three times with DI water, and then place in a trashcan. Place completely empty solvent bottles in the trashcan, making sure caps are in place. The exception to this policy is empty 49% HF bottles, which should be returned to the HF storage cabinet. 
# Nanofab Apparel and Gloves
## Bunnysuits and Booties
You must wear a full bunnysuit to enter the Nanofab (hood, coverall, shoe covers). Facial covers are optional. Change bunnysuits weekly if used often, or at least once a month if used sporadically. Store coverall and hoods on numbered hangers in the gowning room. Reserve a hanger by placing a stainless steel “hanger reserve clip” on the hanger number. Store booties in the corresponding numbered slot in the bootie storage rack. Sandals or any other open toed shoes are not allowed in the Nanofab at any time. 
## Eye Protection
ANSI-approved eye protection must be worn at all times in the Nanofab, except when using optical microscopes. All eye protection eyewear must be ANSI-approved, as indicated by the “Z87” stamp required on the eyewear. You are welcome to use personal prescription safety eyewear which is ANSI-approved. Three types of safety eyewear are stocked in the Nanofab: 
  1. **Uvex Astro 3000** , for use by people who do not wear vision correction glasses. These safety glasses have a black frame.
  2. **Uvex Astro OTG 3001** , for use by people who do wear vision correction glasses. These safety glasses are intended to be worn over vision correction glasses, and have a blue frame.
  3. **U.S. Safety Faceshield**. This full faceshields must be worn when working with dangerous chemicals or materials. Always use a faceshield when working at the HF bench.


## Aprons and Gloves
### General Information
Always wear gloves when in the Nanofab. Acid aprons are required when handling HF and other highly corrosive or toxic chemicals. 
### Five types of gloves are available in the Nanofab:
**Material** |  **Manufacturer/Model** |  **Color** |  **Thickness** |  **Stocked Sizes**  
---|---|---|---|---  
PVC | Kimtech G5 Co-Polymer | Clear | 0.10mm (4 mil) | S, M, L, XL   
Latex | Kimtech G3 Latex | Tan | 0.20mm (8 mil) | 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 10   
Nitrile | Best CleaN-Dex Ultimate | White | 0.15mm (6 mil) | XS, S, M, L, XL

Blend | MAPA TRIonic E-194 | Tan | 0.50mm (20 mil) | 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11   
  * **Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)** : Kimtech G5 Co-Polymer

    A relatively inexpensive static free general-purpose glove, poor for most organics. These gloves break down rapidly in acetone.
  * **Latex** : Kimtech G3 Latex

    A general-purpose glove, poor for most organics, okay with aldehydes and keytones.
  * **Nitrile, White** : Best CleaN-Dex Ultimate

    This thin general purpose low cost glove offers marginal protection from many keytones, okay with some acids and bases.
  * **Nitrile, Green** : MAPA StanSolve A-30

    A thicker nitrile glove that affords increased protection over the CleaN-Dex white nitrile glove.
  * **Nitrile/Neoprene/Latex Blend** : MAPA TRIonic E-194

    This glove is the standard wet processing glove. A blend of latex, neoprene, and carboxylated nitrile, which offers excellent protection from corrosives and solvents such as HF and acetone. Highly resistant to cuts, tears, and snags. Always use this glove when processing with HF, TMAH, or Bromine.
# General Nanofab Information
## Iris Camera Access System
The iris camera access system provides security to the Nanofab, and allows tracking of the time each user spends in the Nanofab. ALWAYS scan in when entering the lab and scan out when exiting the lab, even when attending training sessions or performing beneficial work. Violating this policy will result in a two-week suspension for the first incidence, and possible permanent suspension for recurring incidences. 
## Scheduling Tool/Equipment Use and Tool Supervisors
Tool use is scheduled in one of two ways: 
  1. either through the web-based system “Signupmonkey” at URL: <http://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu>
  2. or first come/first served


  * If a tool is listed on Signupmonkey, you must obtain permission from the supervisor of the tool in order to schedule use of the tool. This is typically accomplished by attending a training session.
  * Some tools are not scheduled using Signupmonkey because the cycle period is typically short and use of the tool is most efficient without using signupmonkey.
  * All tools in the Nanofab have a supervisor, regardless of whether the tool is listed on Signupmonkey.
  * If you have problems with any tool, please inform the supervisor either by email, or direct communication (phone, etc).


## Credit for Beneficial Work in the Nanofab
You will receive 1.5 hours of free processing time for each hour spent performing maintenance on lab equipment, conducting training sessions, or any time spent performing work beneficial to the general operation of the lab. Please indicate time spent performing beneficial work on the sign-up sheet just inside the gowning room. 
## Wet Bench Housekeeping
It is the **user's responsibility** to keep the wet benches clean and organized, and for refilling squirt bottles. Disrespectful use will be reported and may be reprimanded. 
Always leave wet benches clean, dry, and organized. This includes cleaning up all spills, storing glassware and chemicals, etc. 
If a bench is not clean when you start a task, you still have the responsibility to leave it clean. If you leave a wet bench in disarray, or leave an unlabeled container on a bench, you _can be suspended from the Nanofab_. 
Do not cover the exhaust holes on the bench tops, as this will impede the laminar flow of air through the bench and possibly expose you or other Nanofab users to toxic fumes. 
Do not throw solvents, photoresists or other hazardous chemicals into trash cans that are outside the benches - instead use waste collection inside the hoods. This prevents other users from being exposed to these chemicals, avoiding the accumulated hazards of long-term exposure. 
Corrosive-soaked wipes can be rinsed in water at the bench sinks until they are safe (eg. 3x rinse/squeezed dry), and then thrown into the regular waste bins. 
## Hotplates
Hot plates used for heating chemicals must be attended. This means you must be in the Nanofab and near the hot plate whenever it is in use. (This does not apply to PR baking hotplates on the PR spinner benches.) 
## Nanofab Paper
The only paper allowed in the lab is Nanofab type paper. 
We stock many different types of Nanofab paper for the lab, including photocopier (or laserwriter) paper, sticky labels, and assorted notebooks. If you require a special type of Nanofab paper, ask and we will try to obtain it. You can laminate regular paper for use in the lab. Use pens, not pencils, for writing in the lab. 
## Nanofab Wipes
We stock four types of wipes in the lab 
  1. **S/Pec-Wipe 3** is a cellulose/polyester blend with high absorption but medium particle and fiber generation. These are the standard absorbent wipes for general purpose. Note there are fibers that will come off if a wet wafer is placed on top.
  2. **Berkshire Poly1200** is a 100% knit polyethylene wipe with low particulate generation, but also with relatively low absorption. These are available by asking staff for a private bag only.
  3. **PRO-STAT** is a cellulose blend presaturated with isopropyl alcohol and DI water.
  4. **BIOHAZ** are used to line photoresist spinner catch cups


## Preparing Equipment for Entry into the Nanofab
All equipment entering the lab must be clean. The procedure for cleaning equipment for entry is: 
  1. Vacuum while equipment is outside the lab
  2. Wipe down all accessible surfaces with propanol or EKC ""Lab Clean"" using Nanofab wipes while equipment is outside the lab
  3. Move equipment into the lab
  4. Vacuum with HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner when inside the lab


## Maintenance Ways
You may enter maintenance ways without wearing a bunnysuit from outside the Nanofab, or while wearing a bunnysuit from inside the Nanofab. 
## Notes on Particle Counts in the Nanofab
The Nanofab was surveyed with a particle counter, with generally good results. All wet bench work surfaces have extremely low particle counts, better than class 10. The open areas in the lithography area are all better than class 100, and mostly better than class 10. The remainder of the Nanofab tests better than class 1000, and often better than class 100. The Nanofab design specifications stipulated class 100 for litho, class 1000 for everything else. The Nanofab is easily meeting these specs.   

The effectiveness of facemasks was investigated by placing the particle counter directly under a person’s neck while the person moved his head back and forth. Facemasks reduced particle counts, from the equivalent of class 500 without masks to class 100 with masks. Again, this was sampling just below the neck, not at typical substrate surfaces. 
The choice of wipes used in the Nanofab has a more pronounced affect on particle counts. In general, wipes trade absorbency for low particle generation. The Spec-Wipe 3 is the stocked polyester/cellulose blend, high absorbency wipe designed for use in class 100 cleanrooms. Dragging the sampling tube across the surface of a Spec-Wipe 3 resulted in a class 1000 level particle counts. The Berkshire Polx 1200 wipe is the stocked low particle count, 100% knit polyester wipe. This wipe is not as absorbent at the Spec-Wipe 3, but generates fewer particles. Dragging the sampling tube across the surface of a Berkshire Polx 1200 wipe resulted in lower than class 100 level particle counts. 
To summarize, the Nanofab is meeting and exceeding design specifications for particle counts. If you would like to further reduce particles on your substrates, you may implement the following practices, in order of effectiveness: 
  * Use only Berkshire Polx 1200 wipes if your process requires placing your substrate on a wipe
  * Use a facemask if your process requires you to work above your substrate on a table. Facemasks do not reduce particle counts on substrates in wet benches.


## Procedure for the Use and Handling of Precious Metals
Gold, platinum, palladium, and various alloys of these metals are stocked by the UCSB Nanofab. Each research group can be issued a precious metal supply. This supply must be stored in a small lockable container, along with a log sheet for recording the use of these metals. Precious metas, the lockable security container, and log sheets will be issued by the Nanofab manager. All use of precious metals must be accurately recorded on the log sheet, and include user name, date, metal type, metal weight before use, and metal weight after use. Multiple digital scales have been acquired and placed throughout the Nanofab to facilitate weighing of these metals. When requesting additional precious metals, the completed log sheet must be presented to the Nanofab manager. Any discrepancies in recorded precious metal use will result in charges to the principle investigator corresponding to the value of the precious metal discrepancy. 
# Communications and Internet Access
## Wireless Access in the Nanofab and Couryard Café
Currently, we have two wireless networks available to Nanofab users: 
### Nanofab Wireless Access:
The Nanofab has three access points located in the Nanofab. This network is operated by Nanofab staff, and offers anonymous access. You may connect to this network by selecting the following network and entering the password. 
  * network: _nanofab_
  * password: _ece!nanofab_


### UCSB Wireless Network
The Courtyard Café, as well as other locations on campus, provide access to the UCSB wireless network. 
  * **External Users** (Other universities or industrial users)

    Access accounts to external Nanofab user (other university or industrial users) are provided as requested by the Nanofab manager. Please contact the Nanofab manager if you would like an account.
  * **Local academic users** (UCSB grad students, staff, etc)

    Local academic users can access the UCSB wireless network by using their UCSBNetID and password. Information regarding setup of a UCSBNetID and password: <https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/U-reset/AccountManagement.aspx>
# Visitor/Beneficial Lab Work Policy
Visitors are allowed in the lab for observation only. During normal weekday working hours a user should try and obtain a visitor's badge from one of the Nanofab staff to remove any concerns of shadowing another user into the lab without logging in. If it is off hours we expect all users to follow the rules and the honor code of the Nanofab and not abuse this policy. If these simple rule are broken and a visitor is caught operating or handling anything in the lab then both visitor and user will be suspended from the Nanofab. 
**Determining Nanofab beneficial lab time credit:**
1. The two common ways for logging beneficial time: 
a. If you help staff with Nanofab related work such as maintenance, construction or cleanup of equipment or the lab. 
b. If you happen to help/train someone outside of your group unplanned while you are logged in to the Nanofab. Please review the below paragraphs to understand other situations. 
2. When you are training a group member or any other user the correct way to enter the Nanofab is to log in and then take the user in as a visitor. We assume that you are training while you are performing your own work and the other user is only observing. Only one user can be using the equipment and that user should be charged for their use. 
a. This should not be logged as beneficial time as the visitor is not charged. 
3. The other method would be for the new user that is being trained to log in and you will go in as the visitor. This will allow the new user to handle and operate systems while you observe his use as the visitor. 
a. This should not be logged as beneficial time as the visitor is not charged. 
4. Visitor badges can be obtained from the staff during the normal weekday hours and that will remove any confusion about the shadowing of another user without logging in. But on weekends and at nights we expect everyone to follow the honor system and do the right thing. We encourage new users to shadow current users as a visitor to become familiar with the Nanofab before becoming actual users. 
5. The Nanofab relies on the honor system and the visitor “observation only” policy is clear. If users are caught violating the visitor policy and operating/handling anything in the lab while being a visitor both the user and the visitor will be suspended from the lab with no exceptions. 
# Ball Bonding, Wire Bonding, and Packaging Services
We have established an arrangement with PLT Technology to provide various ball bonding and packaging services to UCSB Nanofab users. The service can be provided for you by PLT technology, a local Santa Barbara company, and will be invoiced to your PI through our normal Nanofab recharge system. This service is offered to both academic and industrial Nanofab researchers. A description of the services and associated rates is below. Peter Tihanyi of PLT Technology will provide the service. Peter has a high level of expertise with these processes, especially involving unique or research-type substrates and processes.

There is a minimum charge of 8 hours for each soldering process which includes deposition of indium, chip placement, and chip soldering. The number of devices that can be soldered at the same time depends primarily on the heat sink size. We can supply C-mounts and 9mm packages for $30 each.
  * Vacuum or N2 back-fill of 9mm and TO-3 packages utilizing a POLARIS Accu-Weld 4000 tool. This tool can also be setup for other package configurations. PLT has fixtures for both 9mm and TO-3 packages. However, new fixturing will be required for other package types. The service for 9mm and TO-3 packages up to 10 pieces is $800. We can supply the package for $30 each.
  * Laser diode testing for wavelengths from 400nm to 1600nm utilizing a ILX Lightwave model LPA-9084 laser diode parameter analyzer. The charge is $120 per hour for C-mount. The use of other package types is dependent on the heat sink size, but many other package types can be accommodated.
  * Semiconductor substrate scribe and break service utilizing a Loomis model 100 LSD tool. The setup charge is$120, with a rate of $120 per hour.
  * Lapping and polishing service utilizing a Logitech model PM2 tool. The rate is $120 per hour, with a minimum of 8 hours. Various substrate materials can be processed, including Ga and InP.


  

# Nanofab Summer Intern Policy 
Whenever the intern is in the Nanofab, the mentor must also be in the Nanofab. Interns may use tools that do not require training sessions, such as microscopes, etc, unless the supervisor of these tools objects. Interns can work at photolith benches, and use components of the photolith benches, unless the supervisor of the bench objects. Interns will need to follow normal Nanofab access procedures, including initiation meeting with the Nanofab manager. 
Interns will be allowed to use one or two mainline Nanofab tools after completing training conducted by Nanofab staff. Mainline tools are tools scheduled through our web site signupmonkey. Certain tools will be unavailable to interns due to extremely heavy use or other concerns.

  3. Move ""ex_laser_etch_monitor.py"" & ""nk.py"" out of the examples folder, so they're in the same directory as the ""EMpy"" library folder.
  4. Edit ""ex_laser_etch_monitor.py"" to reflect your structure. 
    1. Set up your materials, layers, and then multi-layer stack.
    2. Refer to the file nk.py for material refractive index/dispersion models, or enter your own. You only need to know n & k at a single wavelength.
    3. You can use multipliers to produce repeating layers, as so: 
      1. _layers = [air] +**5 * [GaAs_DBR, AlGaAs_DBR]** + [GaAs_substrate]_
  5. In Spyder, run the script with ""Interact with shell after execution"" enabled. This allows you to keep messing with the figure and objects after execution, like in Matlab.

## Overview
A number of our dry etching systems have Laser Etch monitors installed, for ""endpoint detection"". These systems allow you to end your etch at a known etch depth, or within a certain layer (with some caveats). They provide optical feedback ""live"" during the etch, allowing you to make the decision to terminate the etch once a target layer has been removed. This nearly eliminates the need to calibrate etch rates or to use timed etching only, which is especially important in our lab where etch rates can vary depending on the previous etches performed in the chamber. 
### Theory of Operation
Laser Etch monitoring works similarly to optical thin-film measurement via reflectivity spectra (eg. like our [Filmetrics systems](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Optical_Film_Spectra_%2B_Optical_Properties_\(Filmetrics_F10-RT-UVX\) ""Optical Film Spectra + Optical Properties \(Filmetrics F10-RT-UVX\)"") - also similar to the [Woollam ellipsometer](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ellipsometer_\(Woollam\) ""Ellipsometer \(Woollam\)""), but different technique). However, instead of varying the optical wavelength and measuring a fixed thin-film, we measure a constant wavelength and a thin-film that is getting thinner as it is etched. Thus, similar to the thin-film measurements, you can only measure a useful signal when the optical properties (reflection or interference) change during your etch. So _if_ you can measure the start/end etch points with a Filmetrics spectrometer, then you could also use Laser Endpoint Monitor to perform the stop ""live"" during your etch. 
For example, etching from high-reflectivity Aluminum to Lower reflectivity Silicon will usually give you a clear drop showing that your Aluminum has been fully etched-through. 
Etching films that are transparent at the laser monitor wavelength (670nm on most) produces a sinusoidal signal due to optical wave interference, which gives you numerous possible stopping points to end the etch upon. See the [examples](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Laser_Etch_Monitoring#Examples) below. 
##### Limitations
Spot Size 
Ideally the entire laser spot should fit inside an etched area of your wafer. The exact spot size varies on different systems based on the distance between Wafer and Laser. For the Intellemetrics systems, an open etched area of about 500 µm or larger is generally adequate to line up your laser spot. The larger the easier the alignment will be. 
You also want to make sure that the laser monitor etched area is accessible to the laser on the system you are using. Please note the laser location on the dry accurate you are targeting, and to make your alignment easier, it may be beneficial to repeat the laser monitoring region on multiple die. 
Layer Requirements 
Because the method is based on optical interference of the incoming beam with a reflected beam, there must be some reflection of the beam by an embedded layer in order to detect an interferometric signal. Thus, the technique _does not help when etching into a substrate_ , but only when stopping within a few microns of a layer boundary. These layer boundaries must have a refractive index difference in order to reflect the light. 
The layered materials should have some transparency at the monitor wavelength of 670 nm, or exhibit a significant change in reflectivity upon etching. Layers that absorb the laser wavelength will still produce an interference signal, but only once those layers are etched thin enough to be partially transparent (eg. ~50nm for Si). You can endpoint on the removal of a metal layer, such as Al, since the reflectivity will drop significantly when the Al is fully removed. 
Uniformity 
Etch uniformity must still be accounted for. The laser monitor will indicate the depth at the specified laser spot, but the user must account for etch rate variations across the wafer (eg. higher etch rate at the edges of a mounted piece). Users typically will overetch past the endpoint to account for this. 
## Procedures
### General Procedure
The basic method for performing an etch with laser monitoring endpoint, is as follows: 
  1. Simulate or estimate what the laser monitor trace will look like, decide when to stop the etch according to the laser monitor plot.
  2. Mount the sample such that the laser will be able to reach a region to monitor the etch - typically ~100-300µm wide area.
  3. Load sample into chamber - wafer transfer **only** , no etch.
  4. Align Laser onto area to monitor using co-axial microscope.
  5. Start laser power monitoring/logging.
  6. Start Etch (time set longer than expected etch time) - etch only, no wafer transfers. 
    1. Closely observe laser monitor plot, comparing to known/simulated plot.
  7. Use ""Next Step"" or ""End Step"" when appropriate laser monitor trace is reached. Wait for process to complete any final steps.
  8. Transfer wafer out of chamber.
  9. Save laser monitor data, turn off laser & microscope illumination.

## Examples
### Monitoring Photoresist Etch Rate
Even if you don't use the laser monitor to determine when your etched material is removed, monitoring the photoresist mask alone is very helpful. For example, you can known exactly what time the photoresist is fully etched through during an etch (even if by accident), allowing you to stop the etch at that time, and still determine selectivity if desired. 
[![example of photoresist monitor during etch.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/6/65/ARC_etch_%2B_Cr_etch_-_UV6_at_2krpm_%28900nm%29_survived_v2_-_screenshot.jpg/900px-ARC_etch_%2B_Cr_etch_-_UV6_at_2krpm_%28900nm%29_survived_v2_-_screenshot.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:ARC_etch_%2B_Cr_etch_-_UV6_at_2krpm_\(900nm\)_survived_v2_-_screenshot.jpg)Monitoring photoresist during two sequential etches: (1) ARC Etch (short O2 etch) from 100sec→120sec, and (2) subsequent Chromium etch (Cl2/O2) from 180sec until the etch completed at 500 sec. Plot shows that the photoresist survived - the sinusoid continued until the etch stopped, indicating that photoresist was still present and being etched. [![annotated laser monitor plot of PR during a 3-step etch.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8a/Annotated_PR_etch_-_Om1000_03_-_ARC_%2B_Cl_%2B_PR_etch_v1.jpg/900px-Annotated_PR_etch_-_Om1000_03_-_ARC_%2B_Cl_%2B_PR_etch_v1.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Annotated_PR_etch_-_Om1000_03_-_ARC_%2B_Cl_%2B_PR_etch_v1.jpg)Monitoring the photoresist during a 3-step etch. Etch (1) Etches the Anti-Reflection underlayer (BARC) with O2, (2) etches Chromium with Cl2/O2 gases, and (3) intentionally etches the photoresist quickly with O2 to remove it fully. Manually Ended the step 30 sec after the plot showed the PR was fully removed, to account for any nonuniformity across the wafer.
### Substrate Temperature Stabilization
We have found that double-side polished epitaxial substrates can show an optical interference during the warm-up phase. If you see this, you need to wait until the substrate temperature has stabilized and the laser interference trace stops changing.

# About
The LEXT OLS4000 3D Laser Measuring Microscope is designed for nanometer level imaging, 3D measurement and roughness measurement. Magnification ranges from 108x - 17,280x satisfy the needs of today's researchers. For a complete description of the tool and its capabilities, please see the above link to the manufacturer’s website. 
### Technique & Capabilities
[![Measurement of 5µm wide posts](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/45/Olypmus_LEXT_Example_Profile_Measurement.png/200px-Olypmus_LEXT_Example_Profile_Measurement.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olypmus_LEXT_Example_Profile_Measurement.png)Example Height/Profile Measurement (click to enlarge)
The LEXT allows you to take height measurements of features too small to reach with a physical Stylus needle, in a non-contact mode that is much faster than engaging an AFM tip. In addition, very large aspect-ratios can be measured - for example, 1mm depth x 50µm width. Confocal microscopy ensures that only surfaces that are in-focus will return a signal to the microscope detector. The LEXT sweeps the focus motor and captures a 2D scan of your sample at each focus step, taken with a blue laser (405 nm). After the scan, the height of each surface is calculated by the focus step which produced the highest laser intensity, and this is constructed into a 3D image by the OLS software. 
Because this is an optical method, films that are optically transparent to blue light and/or have transparent sloping sidewalls can produce non-physical measurements due to optical interference on the sample. In addition, features on the order of the laser wavelength can produce unreliable/non-physical data - for example, the data near (within ~500 nm) very steep slopes, or features ≤ 1.0 µm wide may not be reliable. 
Surfaces that are opaque to the laser wavelength work best, although measurements on rectangular transparent edges do work relatively well. Edges of steps where light does not reflect in an ideal manner often produce non-physical features, typically manifesting as trenches/spikes right next to the sidewall. 
Technically the height-resolution is specified as 10 nm (the height resolution of the focus motor), but in practice, noise and optical uncertainties worsen this spec.

Lift-Off with DUV Imaging + PMGI Underlayer,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lift-Off_with_DUV_Imaging_%2B_PMGI_Underlayer,"```
Developed by Demis D. John, ~2017-2019

```

This process is intended for Deep-UV Exposure on the ASML DUV Stepper. PMGI is used as the underlayer, which is exposed at the same time as the imaging resist. 
Adjust spin speed or switch to a different PMGI formulation to tailor the underlayer thickness to your desired metal thickness.

## Tips
Please see our [Bi-Layer Lift-Off Tutorial](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/b/bc/Liftoff-Techniques.pdf) to understand the limitations and requirements for good lift-off. 
  * Remember that gaps in between adjacent metal traces can lift-off during the develop!


  * Need underlayer thickness approx. 2x the desired metal thickness.


  * The underlayer will develop laterally from both sides which can lift-off the imaging resist, so: 
    * Minimum gap between adjacent metals should then be: _greater than 0.5 * underlayer thickness_
    * Want at least 30-50nm of underlayer width left to support the imaging resist, so the PR doesn't fall over/collapse.


  * Make sure to use a vertical evaporation line-of-sight such as [EBeam4](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_4_\(CHA\) ""E-Beam 4 \(CHA\)"") or [EBeam1](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_1_\(Sharon\) ""E-Beam 1 \(Sharon\)""). [EBeam3](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_3_\(Temescal\) ""E-Beam 3 \(Temescal\)"") is not vertical unless special care is taken.


### Process Limits
This process is written with PMGI SF-5 @ 4krpm, which spins to about 130nm 
  * _Maximum metal thickness_ = 130nm/2 ≈ **65nm** (can possibly increase up to 130nm* 2/3 ≈ 85nm)
  * Undercuts laterally about 130-140nm, so _minimum gap between metals_ = (2 x 140nm) + ~30nm ≈ **350nm**


Adjust the PMGI layer thickness to adjust these process limits. 
PMGI could be spun thicker, or double-spun to get thicker underlayers (develop time & undercut will increase accordingly). 
PMGI underlayer could be replaced with LOL1000/LOL2000, or another developable underlayer. 
## Suggested Process for Liftoff
De-H2O Bake (eg. 220°C, 1m+) - or - Technics O2 ash (300mT, 100W), 15sec  | Oxygen ash is faster and more effective   
---|---  
Spin PMGI SF-5 @ 4krpm (rcp 7)  |   
POLOS underside clean: 2000rpm, ACE/ISO/N2  |   
PMGI-Bake: 220°C, 3min (BrewerSci lift-pin hotplate).  | Can just place wafer directly onto hotplate surface. Optionally can use lift-pins & Recipe ""**00 220deg, 3min Vac** "";  --> To prevent wafer sliding: Enable Vacuum with overhead valve, only for wafer landing and then turn off.   
Spin UV-6-0.8 @ rcp 6 (3.5krpm)  |   
POLOS underside clean: 2000rpm, ACE/ISO/N2  |   
Soft-Bake = 135°C, 1min (builtin hotplate)  |   
(check underside for particulates)  |   
**_ASML Exposure_** |   
Default: Exp = 37.5mJ // foc = –0.10  | Try this exposure dose but might need to do a FocArray (smaller Image Distribution eg. 5x5) to find proper exposure.   
PEB = 135°C, 1.5min (built-in hotplate)  |   
Dev (300MiF) = 50sec (CRITICAL time)  | Use cassette & H2O rinse dish prepared --> not stirring, instead very slow/gentle lift/drop at various angles or gentle swish just to mix developer slightly.   
DI rinse  | Very Gently! Dunk into prepared DI dish, and dump/fill gently 2x. Don’t allow direct hard water to hit PR surface.   
Dry - either low-pressure N2, or spin-dry  | 4-inch wafers - use spin-dry on POLOS spinner. Small samples - use low-pressure (eg. 15psi) N2 gun.   
PEii Technics O2: 30sec (100W/300mT)  | May increase feature size openings by ~50nm.   
**_Metal Evaporation_** (insert steps)  | EBeam#4 or EBeam#1 with vertical/4-inch holders (not planetary)   
**_Lift-off in NMP_** | Facing down or vertical. Optional: going directly into continuous Ultrasonic can reduce residual particles.   
## Data
• For PMGI Baked at 220°C for 3min, the PMGI dissolves in AZ 300MIF at a rate of approximately ~600nm/min.

Lift-Off with I-Line Imaging Resist + LOL2000 Underlayer,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lift-Off_with_I-Line_Imaging_Resist_%2B_LOL2000_Underlayer,"  

This process uses LOL2000 as the underlayer, underneath an SPR955 imaging resist layer. 
The LOL2000 dissolves in developer regardless of exposure conditions, so as soon as the Imaging resist has been fully the developed, the LOL2000 will start to develop out and undercut. 
The SPR955 Imaging resist can be exposed on any I-Line exposure tool. You can find starting exposure parameters for SPR955CM-0.8 on the recipe pages for the exposure tool you are using: 
[MA6 Contact](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Alignment_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28MA-6.29 ""Contact Alignment Recipes"") / [GCA Stepper #1](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28GCA_6300.29 ""Stepper Recipes"") / [GCA Stepper #2](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28AutoStep_200.29 ""Stepper Recipes"") / [MLA150](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28MLA_150.29 ""MLA Recipes"")
You can also replace the SPR955 Imaging PR with another I-Line PR (for example, negative PR), assuming it uses a similar developer - just change only the Imaging PR bake/exposure steps below. 
For Steppers and the MLA, you may want to run a focus-exposure matrix to determine the best dose/focus, since focus is a significant variable that depends on the underlying substrate's optical properties as well. 
## Tips
Please see our [Bi-Layer Lift-Off Tutorial](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/b/bc/Liftoff-Techniques.pdf) to understand the limitations and requirements for good lift-off. 
  * Remember that the PR protecting the gaps between adjacent metal traces can lift-off during the develop! You can reduce the develop time to mitigate this.


  * Need underlayer thickness approx. 2x the desired metal thickness.


  * The underlayer will develop laterally from both sides which can lift-off the imaging resist, so: 
    * Minimum gap between adjacent metals should then be: _greater than 0.5 * underlayer thickness_
    * Want at least 30-50nm of underlayer width left to support the imaging resist, so the PR doesn't fall over/collapse.


  * Make sure to use a vertical line-of-sight evaporation such as [EBeam4](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_4_\(CHA\) ""E-Beam 4 \(CHA\)"") or [EBeam1](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_1_\(Sharon\) ""E-Beam 1 \(Sharon\)"").

## Suggested Process for Liftoff
[PEII Asher](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)""): O2 300mT/100W, 1 min  | This is equivalent to Dehydration Bake, eg. 135°C, 1min bake.   
---|---  
[LOL 2000](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/6/6b/LOL2000-Underlayer-Datasheet.pdf), Spin @ 2500 rpm, 40 sec  | LOL 2000 is stored right on the spinner bench (not in refrigerator). Dispense into a bottle for your group. See [datasheet](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/6/6b/LOL2000-Underlayer-Datasheet.pdf) for **develop rate vs. bake temp** , and spin curves.   
Bake at 180°C, 5 min  | Use one of the bench-top adjustable hotplates. Bake temp determines dissolution rate.   
SPR955CM-0.9 spin @ 3krpm (Spin Recipe #5)  | This is the imaging resist. You can replace this with another I-Line PR, just make sure to also change the bake and exposure params.   
Bake at 95°C, 90 sec  | Use built-in hotplate in Bay 6 spinner bench.   
Expose on I-Line tool with appropriate Dose/Focus  | Get starting params (Dose/Focus) for **SPR955CM-0.9** from the Recipes section of your favorite I-Line exposure tool: [MA6 Contact](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Alignment_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28MA-6.29 ""Contact Alignment Recipes"") / [GCA Stepper #1](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28GCA_6300.29 ""Stepper Recipes"") / [GCA Stepper #2](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28AutoStep_200.29 ""Stepper Recipes"") / [MLA150](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28MLA_150.29 ""MLA Recipes"") - For steppers and MLA, you may want to run a focus-exposure matrix to determine the best dose/focus.  - You can overexpose to ensure full exposure if feature dimension is tolerant.   
PEB at 110°C, 90 sec  |   
Develop in AZ300MIF, 90 sec  | Overdevelop ~30sec to undercut the LOL2000, after Imaging PR is developed through.   
DI Rinse and N2 Dry  | For very narrow/small PR ridges remaining (eg. <2µm), very _gentle_ DI rinse + dry might be necessary to prevent PR collapsing.   
Microscope inspection  | May be able to see a 2nd line behind the Imaging PR edge, which is the undercut into the LOL underlayer.   
[PE-II Asher](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)""), O2, 300mT/100W, 30sec  | Improves metal adhesion to substrate. May also widen features by few hundred nm.   
**Metal Evaporation:** [eBeam#1](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_1_\(Sharon\) ""E-Beam 1 \(Sharon\)"") or [eBeam#4](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_4_\(CHA\) ""E-Beam 4 \(CHA\)"") Adhesion Layer (Ti, Cr): 5nm  Metal Layer (any metal): 100nm  | Many common metals (Au, Pt) require the use of an adhesion layer like Ti or Cr, which create an interface between oxide and metal interfaces. For some metals you can omit this, for example Aluminum.   
**Liftoff:** Soak in AZ NMP rinse at 80 C (hot-water bath or hotplate)  overnight (>>2hrs)  | Observe every few hours to see if metal has fully lifted off. If you see metal still attached in large (>1cm) areas with photoresist, you need to wait longer.    
Can optionally speed up by  - Soaking for 1hr in NMP, then  - Transfer to Fresh NMP @ 70°C Ultrasonic bath for 5 min, then,  - ISO beaker in Ultrasonic bath for 1 min, then  - DI rinse and N2 Dry   
Solvent clean: ISO soak 1min,  ISO soak (clean beaker) 1min  N2 dry on napkin  | Only move to this step if metal liftoff has completed (PR has fully dissolved everywhere).   
Microscope Inspection  | Check for PR residue (use DIC/Nomarski mode), and clean metal liftoff.   
Optional: [PE-II Asher](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)""), O2, 300mT/100W, 30sec  | If you see PR residues in the microscope, this can be used to etch away those residues.

Lithography Calibration - Analyzing a Focus-Exposure Matrix,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lithography_Calibration_-_Analyzing_a_Focus-Exposure_Matrix,"On tools that have motorized autofocus (steppers & direct-write litho tools), you often need to analyze both the Focus Offset & Exposure Dose simultaneously. (Remember that ""Focus Offset"" is an offset from the autofocus' ""zero"" position of the wafer surface.) These tools will have a function for shooting a ""Focus Exposure Matrix/Array"", or ""FEM/FEA"", which exposes a grid with Dose varying in one direction, and Focus varying in another, for example: 
| Dose →

### General process:
  1. Prepare a substrate _optically similar_ to your ""real"" sample, on which to run the FEM. 
    1. The optical reflections from thin-films on your sample can make a big difference to optical exposure conditions.
    2. You can use your ""real"" sample, as long as the PR strip process does not damage the substrate (eg. if the PR strips with NMP cleanly, and your substrate is compatible with the solvents used.).
    3. For example, if you will be exposing I-Line onto a Silicon Substrate with 500nm SiO2, it would be best to do your FEM on a similar substrate.
    4. If your substrate will be optically opaque at some layer you can safely ignore buried layers beneath the opaque layer. 
      1. For example, if you have a complex epitaxial sample that is coated in 500nm Pt, then you can make a ""dummy"" sample that is just 500nm Pt on Silicon, since UV light will not penetrate past the Pt layer anyway, so your dummy sample will still be optically similar to the real sample.
      2. DUV light is absorbed by many materials, in addition to the bottom-anti-relfection layers used for DUV removing some of the effect of the substrate - so for DUV exposures using a BARC layer, the substrate often has a smaller effect.
  2. Run a ""Coarse"" (wide-range) Focus-Exposure Matrix using the ""starting params"" from the wiki for your PR/tool. 
    1. ""Coarse"" Dose typically means ~10% of a ""nominal"" dose - starter Doses can be found on the Litho Recipes pages for the tool and resist you are using.
    2. Defocus varies per system. 
      1. GCA Steppers: ""Coarse"" focus may be ±2 defocus value
      2. MLA150: ""Coarse"" focus generally means spanning almost the entire system range, from -25 to +25 defocus.
      3. ASML 5500/300: ""Coarse"" focus variation is ±0.10 to 0.15µm.
  3. Analyze (microscope or SEM) to find the edges of the 
    1. Tip: If possible, mark up your wafer with sharpie, scribes or other marks to make the grid easier to analyze, especially to avoid getting ""lost"" on the SEM/microscope.
    2. This analysis also yields what ""coarse"" vs. ""fine"" steps are for your process.
  4. Run a ""Fine"" FEM with finer step size in focus & dose. 
    1. On the ASML, you can now keep the Focus constant according to the central Focus value from your Coarse FEM, and do only an Energy serpentine.
  5. Analyze to measure actual feature size, according to your process tolerance. 
    1. Choose Dose/Focus in the middle of the process window to make the process ""tolerant"" to variations.


### Process Window
You need to find the **center of the _Viable_** - meaning you need to see the BAD dose (too high + too low) and BAD focus (too high + too low) then choose a Dose+Focus in the _middle_ of this range. This allows your process to work even if the focus or some other process varies. 
A **common mistake is to look for ""_the best die_ ""** - but this die could be (and often is) at the edge of the working process window, so a small process variation (wafer thickness, hotplate temperature) will put your process outside the process window - you'll have chosen a very tight process that easily goes out of spec with random fluctuation in the process. 
### Tolerance
You'll need to decide what ""good enough"" looks like on your feature inspection - this is your process _**tolerance**_. In physical manufacturing you simply can never achieve ""perfect"" features, with 6 decimals points of precision - or you will spend a lot of time and money trying to do so. 
For example instead of looking for ""_the feature that is exactly 300nm wide_ "", you may want to look for Dose/Focus where ""_the feature is between 250-350nm, or 300nm±50nm_ "". Thus your process has a viable tolerance to normal fabrication variations. You may want to run simulations or other estimates for what the tolerance may be. 
### Example FEMs
An ideal FEM would look like this, for example for a Photoresist process where the ""nominal"" process from our Litho Recipes pages shows 15mJ dose & +0.1µm focus. 
**√** : process within tolerance, eg. linewidth is 200nm ± 50nm 
**X** : out of tolerance, or entirely failed (no feature) 
| → Dose →  |   
---|---|---  
↓ **Focus** **↓** |  | 11mJ  | 12mJ  | 13mJ  | 14mJ  | 15mJ  | 16mJ  | 17mJ  | 18mJ   
-0.2µm  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X   
-0.1µm  | X  | X  | X  | √  | X  | X  | X  | X   
0  | X  | X  | √  | √  | √  | √  | X  | X   
+0.1µm  | X  | √  | √  | √  | √  | √  | X  | X   
+0.2µm  | X  | √  | √  | √  | √  | √  | X  | X   
+0.3µm  | X  | X  | √  | √  | √  | X  | X  | X   
+0.4µm  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X   
(Yes, this takes some time on a microscope and/or SEM to analyze!) 
Now if we highlight the ""good"" region, we can identify the Process Window: 
| → Dose →  |   
---|---|---  
↓ **Focus** **↓** |  | 11mJ  | 12mJ  | 13mJ  | 14mJ  | 15mJ  | 16mJ  | 17mJ  | 18mJ   
-0.2µm  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
-0.1µm  |  |  |  | √  |  |  |  |   
0  |  |  | √  | √  | √  | √  |  |   
+0.1µm  |  | √  | √  | √  | √  | √  |  |   
+0.2µm  |  | √  | √  | √  | √  | √  |  |   
+0.3µm  |  |  | √  | √  | √  |  |  |   
+0.4µm  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
This shows that the middle of the Process Window should be at approx.: 
  * Dose = 14mJ
  * Focus Offset = +0.15µm


And the process tolerance is: 
  * Dose ±2mJ
  * Focus Offset ± 0.15µm


Hopefully the litho tool you are using can control better than ±2mJ and ±0.15µm focus! Different litho tools may have different random variation in these parameters. Your photoresist thickness, spin repeatability, and substrate flatness (causing focus variations) will all contribute to litho fluctuations. 
The wider the process tolerance, the less we have to rework or calibrate the process, so the faster we can finish our lithography!

### FEM Problems
A common problem with a coarse FEM is to miss the process window - If you **don't see the ""BAD"" die on all sides** , then you don't know whether you have captured the center. This might be acceptable if you know the litho tool/process is tolerant enough (eg. very large feature sizes), but if you have a small/sensitive process window (eg. small feature sizes), then this could be an issue. 
| → Dose →  |   
---|---|---  
↓ **Focus** **↓** |  | 11mJ  | 12mJ  | 13mJ  | 14mJ  | 15mJ  | 16mJ  | 17mJ  | 18mJ   
-0.2µm  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
-0.1µm  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
0  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
+0.1µm  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
+0.2µm  |  |  | √  | √  | √  |  |  |   
+0.3µm  |  | √  | √  | √  | √  | √  |  |   
+0.4µm  |  |  | √  | √  | √  | √  |  |   
You may need to go back and shoot another coarse FEM, in this example with higher Focus = +0.1µm → +0.7µm and same Dose range as before. 
Another issue is to see an **non-contiguous FEM** , like so: 
| → Dose →  |   
---|---|---  
↓ **Focus** **↓** |  | 11mJ  | 12mJ  | 13mJ  | 14mJ  | 15mJ  | 16mJ  | 17mJ  | 18mJ   
-0.2µm  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
-0.1µm  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
0  |  |  | √  |  |  | √  | √  |   
+0.1µm  |  |  | √  |  |  | √  | √  |   
+0.2µm  |  |  | √  | √  |  | √  | √  |   
+0.3µm  |  | √  | √  | √  |  |  |  |   
+0.4µm  |  |  |  | √  | √  |  |  |   
This may be due to a location-dependent variation. For example, the wafer surface has large-area bumps (eg. delaminating thin-films), or particles on the back of the wafer during exposure, either of which cause the topside focus-level to change depending on wafer location, or major defects in the photoresist spin (streaks etc). 
The above FEM might actually have a very wide process window, but the center of the wafer had a defect causing bad resolution.

Recipes pre-loaded on the S-Cubed Flexi automated coat/bake/develop system. Only staff may write new recipes, contact the tool supervisor for more info. 
### Available Variations
  * We have different recipes with varyious UV6 spin speeds - the same spin speed optionss as found on our manual Headway spinners. This allows for PR thickness control. See the linked UV6 datasheets below for thickness vs. rpm spin curves. **Note** that exact spin RPM may be slightly different between Headway spinners (on benches) vs. S-Cubed.
  * DSK is recommended to be spun at 1.5krpm (~40nm) for best anti-reflection properties. 5krpm (~20nm) recipes are also provided for historical/legacy processes.
  * DSK can be baked at either 220C to act as a Dry-etchable BARC (similar to DUV-42P), or at lower temps as a developable BARC (no dry etch required).
  * ""Chain"" recipes (with DSK+UV6 spin/cured in succession) are only available for DSK Baked at 185C & 220C, and all UV6 Spin-speed variations. For the other DSK temps you can use the single-PR ""Routes"".
  * Developer recipes are now available for 300 MiF Developer. **Note** that developer is flowing continuously during the develop, so _develop times are shorter by ~50%_ compared to beaker developing. 
    * **DO NOT EDIT developer recipes** , they can damage the tool when programmed incorrectly!
  * ""Chain"" recipes for 135*C Post-exposure Bake + Develop have been made.
  * ASML cassettes can be placed directly on this tool for spin / exposure / develop process. Please make sure all cassettes are kept back at their respecting tools when done.

See: [Stepper Recipes#Anti-Reflective Coatings](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Anti-Reflective_Coatings ""Stepper Recipes"") **185°C bake** allows the DSK to dissolve during develop, and allows for undercut (may lift-off small features)  **220°C bake** allows DSK to be used as dry-etchable BARC (equiv. to DUV42P), requiring O2 etch to remove. Better for small features. See [here for relevant processing info from DUV42P](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Anti-Reflective_Coatings ""Stepper Recipes"").  **Note: All PR coat recipes have EBR backside clean steps included in the recipe.**

_Procedure for wax-mounting a 100mm Silicon wafer to another 100mm silicon carrier wafer, using the[**Logitech WBS7 Wafer Bonder**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wafer_Bonder_\(Logitech_WBS7\) ""Wafer Bonder \(Logitech WBS7\)"")._
  * Cover Hotplate surface with tinfoil,
  * Heat hotplate to 150°C. 
    * Bay 5 solvent bench is preferred
    * Keep flammable solvents away!
  * Place 4"" polished handle wafer on hotplate.
  * Apply wax to center of carrier wafer only. 
    * For mounting a 4-inch wafer, you need a good amount of wax to ensure coverage to wafer edges, eg._2-3mm thick_.
    * For 4-inch wafers, We have found that ~2.3 grams of wax is the right amount. Cut a ~1cm chunk off the CrystalBond wax stick with razor, then cut that into 2/3rds, weigh with tared scale in Bay 5.
    * Should produce approximately _2-inch diameter_ size puddle of crystal bond wax.
    * If you need to adjust the wax amount, you can use a transparent top-substrate to observe whether full coverage is achieved. Few millimeter-sized bubbles typically are acceptable.
  * Place the top wafer on the melted wax at this step, and align wafer flats while wax is wet.
  * Remove wafers from hotplate and cool on _clean_ napkin (do not let wax stick to surfaces while cooling). Check that wafer flat alignment is good.
  * Open Logitech Bonder chamber: 
    * Unscrew clamp until higher than clamp arm,
    * Swing front of clamp arm to the left (Difficult to disengage),
    * Lift bonder lid (also takes some force to open - ignore vacuum reading on digital display)
  * Place 6"" filter paper on the glass plate of the logitech.
  * Place wafers on top of the filter paper, on the glass plate of the Logitech bonder.
  * Place 6"" filter paper on top of the wafers. Wafers shouldhave filter paper on _top and bottom_ to catch excess wax.
  * Close and lock Logitech bonder hatch.
  * Turn on Logitech bonder power (bottom right of machine chassis)
  * On front panel of Logitech bonder, confirm that Applied Pressure gauge is set to 5 psi.
  * Enter the process settings: 
    * [setup] -> [Temp] 
      * Bonding: 120°C
      * Endpoint: 65°C
      * Offset: 20°C

      * Proceed if Below: 2.4E+01 mBar
      * Abort if Below: 3.2E+01 mBar
    * [setup] -> [Process Control] 
      * Process: Heat + Outgas

    * It is normal to see wax on the filter paper, indicating full/over-coverage. However you might need to adjust the wax amount to prevent too much wax escaping the wafer and causing too thick a bonding layer. About ~1cm of leaking wax on the filter paper is ideal.
  * If wax leaked onto the glass plate: remove glass plate and clean with Acetone+Wipe. The surfaces must be very clean of wax when you're done, or else the lid or wafers may get stuck on the next run.
  * Turn off Logitech bonder (bottom right of machine chassis) 
    * Close lid and clamp
  * Clean excess wax off your wafer using the [POLOS Spinners](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wet_Benches#Automated_Wet-processing_Spinners_.28POLOS.29 ""Wet Benches""), and an Acetone squirt bottle, followed by ISO & N2 dry (run both sides of the wafer, multiple times if needed).

MLA150 - CAD Files and Templates,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_CAD_Files_and_Templates,"## Alignment Marks
Alignment Crosses can be exposed by the MLA150 itself (good for full wafers with open areas on the edges) using the _Expose Bitmaps_ field in the Job Setup, or can be included in your CAD file (good for smaller pieces without much unused edge area). 
Any cross shape with a 10-50µm wide line will work for automatic alignment. By default, system expects this cross shape to cover/extend beyond the entire field of view of the chosen microscope, which are the following sizes: 
Alignment mark sizes should be larger than the following  Camera  | Field of View   
---|---  
Low Mag.  | 640 x 480 µm   
High Mag.  | 190 x 140 µm   
For the best alignment, the High-Mag camera is preferred, so a Cross of ~250µm x 200µm (50µm larger than the high-mag. FOV), with line width of 20µm would be acceptable. 
The coordinates to the center of each mark should be known, with respect to the origin (0,0) of the CAD file to be exposed. 
## Resolution and Calibration Patterns
Resolution test patterns and Alignment Verniers can be found on the local MLA150 computer in the `.../Users-Nanofiles/a-Public Templates` folder. 
Has line-space resolutions from 65nm → 1.0µm. Isolated versus dense lines are shown via lines protruding further beyond the dense patterns. The text indicates the ""period"" - twice the line/space width. 
You will find two such files on the tool: 
  * _UCSB_MLA150_Calibration_pattern_v5_UnitCell.gds_ - a single unit cell of the pattern, used for focus-exposure matrix (series) 
    * Image Size for the Unit-Cell: 500 x 650µm for stitching the alignment crosses of adjacent die.
  * _UCSB_MLA150_Calibration_pattern_v5_AcrossWafer.gds_ - covers a 100mm wafer, used for alignment vernier testing.

## General CAD Guidelines
  * GDS / GDSii is the preferred file format (fewest errors). DXF, CIF, BMP and Gerber are also available.
  * Note the Cell that you want to print. Only one Cell may be selected in the software, so use Cell Instancing to create combinations/hierarchy of Cells to print.
  * Note the Layer(s) to print. The system can select either a single Layer, or can combine multiple layers via Boolean OR.
  * The Origin (0,0) in your file is the reference for all coordinates during exposure, including alignment mark exposure/measurement. 
    * The Origin is usually placed at the _Center_ of your wafer/substrate. Autofocus usually initializes at this location, so it's important that it's _not_ at the edge of your wafer where there is badly formed photoresist/cleaved edges.
  * Your file name cannot contain any spaces or special characters except for underscores.
  * Make sure the file extension is all lower case (e.g. `.gds` not `.GDS`) - some design programs (e.g. Klayout) will create a file with an upper case file extension by default.
  * We recommend that your filename starts with your LastnameFirstinitial, similar to job/design names for easy finding later. For example, Demis D. John's GDS files would be named `johnd_MyCadDesign_Layer1_v2.gds`.


## CAD Design File Specifications
### Compatibility with Heidelberg's _convert_ software
We recommend to keep two versions of your CAD design - 
  1. Your ""Editable"" version that you can easily edit designs with, that keeps your separated Cells, Arrays, PCells such as Text/Circle objects, and possibly is saved in OASIS format.
  2. An ""exposure"" version where you make the file compatible with the heidelberg software by: 
    1. Save as `*.gds` with your name at the start of the filename, eg. `johnd_UCSB_device1_L10_v1.gds`.
    2. Convert all PCells to Static Cells,
    3. Resolve Arrays - especially orthogonal arrays, which cause issues.
    4. Turn off any options that reduce compatibility, such as ""Save cell context info"" etc. MLA software has issues with those.
    5. Optionally _Flatten_ all objects (removes all Cells) and delete all unused Cells
    6. Optionally Save _only_ the Layers to be printed (turn off other layers, and ""Save only Visible Layers""). These reduce chances of human-error during the MLA program setup.
    7. This is the file you'll upload to the MLA for exposure.


### GDS aka. GDSii
  * This is the preferred file format for import into the machine.


  * Make note of the ""Cell"" that you want to print, often called the ""top cell"" as it can contain a hierarchy of other child/instanced cells. 
    * This is called ""GDS Structure"" in the _Convert_ software.
  * Note the Layer to be printed. On the MLA, you can boolean Union (combine) multiple layers, or print only one layer.


### DXF
Common export format for users of AutoCAD. Export with AutoCAD R12 compatibility. 
  * DXF files don't define the ""units"" when exported, so you must type in the designed length units in _Convert_ software during import. Eg. whether a length of ""10"" means ""10 mm"" or ""10 µm"".
  * It is easy for these files to have ""open polygons"", meaning the ends of the polygon don't attach, preventing the software from calculating the filled-in area to write. You can use L-Edit or KLayout's Design Rule Check automation to try and locate these kinds of errors.
  * Make sure to use _Convert_ 's [Viewer] and the [Measure] tool to make sure the scaling factors are correct.
  * Note the Layer to be printed. You can boolean Union (combine) multiple layers, or print only one layer.


### BMP
The BMP Pixelsizes are shown in the BMP options when importing a file into _Convert_. 
The BMP pixel size can be adjusted to change the scaling of the bmp file. The base pixel size is 40nm per pixel, and can be adjusted up to 4000nm in increments of 40nm (eg. _pixel size = 40nm, 80nm, 120nm ... 3960nm, 4000nm_). 
### CIF
_To Be Added_
### Gerber
_To Be Added_
## Alignment Marks
The system is very versatile, and can align to any feature you like using ""Manual Alignment"", as long as you know the coordinates of that feature with respect to your CAD file's origin (0,0). 
You can use the software to shoot the alignment marks for you, on a first (or other) layer. That method is best for circular wafers that tend to have open, unused areas on the outer edges, perfect for placing an alignment mark (with no die). You can also use the ""**Expose Bitmaps** "" function in the Setup Job screen to have the system expose crosses for you, at coordinates that you provide. (Coordinates are always w/r/to your CAD file 0,0 origin.) 
You can optionally place the marks directly inside your die. 
The system will only need at least 4 marks at different places on the wafer (8 max) for global alignment. Preferably, these should be placed as far apart as possible (for rotation/scaling measurement), and at different quadrants of the wafer (for shearing/orthogonality). 
### Automatic Alignment
Automatic alignment (ie. automatic measuring of the mark, or Field/""Local"" Alignment) requires a basic Cross ✚ shape, for example with 20µm line width (10µm to 50µm should work). 
The cross extents need to fill the whole camera field of view, which are as follows: 
Minimum size of Cross for auto. alignment  Camera  | Field of View   
---|---  
Low Res.  | 640 x 480 µm   
High Res.  | 190 x 140 µm   
**So a cross of 30µm line width, that is 800 x 600µm would be adequate.**
If your cross does not fill the whole field, you can use the Reduced Detection Area button to make the image detection measure in a smaller area. 
### [Aligning to a quarter-wafer/irregular piece](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Aligning_to_a_quarter-wafer/irregular_piece ""MLA150 - Troubleshooting"")
See the above link for how to align to the cleaved edges of an irregular piece. 
## High-Resolution Writing
It has been suggested to use the ""CD Bias"" (Critical dimension) to reduce your feature sizes during the _Convert_ process, and then compensate by going to higher exposure doses (widening the features back to original size). If you choose a ""-200 nm"" CD Bias, then run a Focus-Exposure Array (""Series"" in _MLAMenu_), you will look for the higher/lower doses (depending on photoresist and design polarity) that bring the features back to the original designed sizes. 
Overexposing alleviates the stitching boundaries. 
## Greyscale Lithography
Please see the Manual for greyscale options and details. 
BMP and DXF are acceptable formats for greyscale lithography. The _Convert_ program accepts values 0-255 grey levels, although you can run any number of grey-levels from binary (2 levels) up to 256 levels (0-255). 
### Limitations & Workarounds
Greyscale exposure has the following limitations that we have identified: 
  1. **Alignment - workarounds** :

```
As of 2024-11, Heidelberg have added alignment capability to Greyscale exposures, but this hasn’t yet been tested by staff. Please let us know if you try this out. 

```

  1.     1. the native software does not have rotational alignment capabilities implemented for greyscale exposures. To prevent the software from silently failing during greyscale exposure, you must _DIS_ able **[_]** _**Expose with** **Substrate Angle**_ and/or **[_]_Rotation, Scaling and Shearing_** during exposure or the _software will fail to expose_ (with no error, exposure will begin but then suddenly stop after a few minutes). Workarounds - read _both_ of the following before proceeding, as you'll need to combine both methods into your CAD file to implement both X-Y and Rotational alignment: 
      1. X-Y Alignment workaround: 
        1. Identify an alignment mark or other feature on your wafer with known coordinates with respect to your CAD file.
        2. Set that location in your CAD file to coordinates (0,0). (Recommended: put your entire design into a [sub-Cell](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips#Cells_.26_Instances_of_Cells ""KLayout Design Tips"") and apply the X/Y shift to that [Cell Instance](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips#Cells_.26_Instances_of_Cells ""KLayout Design Tips"") via the Instance's X/Y insertion position or a _Move_ operation.)
        3. Once you are at the _**Exposure**_ portion of the procedure, drive the microscope and crosshair to the feature that you designated as (0,0) on your CAD file. Use the [**⨁**] button to use precise positioning via clicking on the microscope image.
        4. Click **[Set Zero]** to set the origin (0,0) of your CAD file at that location of the crosshair. 
          1. [![Screenshot showing MLA150 ""Set Zero"" button.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cd/MLA_Set_Zero_button_IMG_2352.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MLA_Set_Zero_button_IMG_2352.jpg)
        5. (See below for Rotation alignment correction - to be performed _before_ the X-Y alignment set, but also requires editing the CAD file.)
      2. Rotation Alignment workaround: 
        1. Load your substrate onto the vacuum chuck and run [Load Substrate] function. 
          1. _**IMPORTANT**_ : _Do not unload your substrate_ until the exposure is complete! We will be correcting the misalignment with respect to the substrate's load position, so once you have loaded the substrate, you do not want to release vacuum or otherwise allow the substrate to move w/r/to the vacuum chuck.
        2. Run a dummy binary-design design as a ""normal"" 2nd-Layer exposure with Alignment, and align to a few marks on your wafer. In the ""Exposure"" screen it'll show your the resulting _Rotation (and Scaling/Shearing)_ values calculated from your alignment marks.
        3. Record the _Rotation_ value (Scaling/Shearing are optional - if they are far from nominal, you may want to account for these as well).
        4. Do _NOT_ run the exposure, but instead exit the Exposure and go back to the **[_< < Setup_]** screen.
        5. Edit your CAD file and apply the rotation to the CAD file. (Recommended: put your entire design into a [sub-Cell](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips#Cells_.26_Instances_of_Cells ""KLayout Design Tips"") and apply the rotation to that [Cell Instance](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips#Cells_.26_Instances_of_Cells ""KLayout Design Tips""). Not you'll likely have to convert between µRadians --> Degrees).
        6. Load this corrected CAD file into the Design via ""Convert Design"". (Will require a fresh conversion.)
        7. Use the _Above_ ""X-Y Alignment Workaround"" method to align your CAD file to the sample, before running your exposure.
  2. **Stitching** : Because our tool is the higher-throughput version that exposes a ~20µm field at a time (not a single spot), greyscale exposures will typically see the stitching boundaries between fields. The fast-scan axis is in Y, so you generally will see Y-oriented ridges with something like ~4-7% lower dose. This primarily manifests for greyscale because photoresist is being only partially exposed. (For regular binary exposure, users typically overexpose which hides this stitching boundary.)
  3. **Time** : Your will need to sign up for significantly more time to run a greyscale exposure. The software requires an initial “conversion” of the CAD file - which takes 45-60min for a 100mm wafer with 50% fill. (Be patient - the progress bar may not indicate it is working, but it is!) Once that is complete the Design shows up in the list for exposure - you can expose it any time thereafter. The exposure is also much longer than binary: 50% fill on a 100mm wafer took 12 hours. (Small substrates should be much shorter.) Staff did the Conversion and Exposure two separate sessions, on different days to accomplish the full litho. Contact Staff if you need to book the tool overnight for such a session.
  4. **File size** can be an issue. We have found that for full-wafers, DXF is the only format that works - BMP files that cover an entire 100mm wafer result in file sizes too large for the _Convert_ software to handle, it will silently fail/crash.
  5. **Minimum Dose** : In order to expose at low doses, you may need to enable the 15% filter in the exposure menu. Use this if the software disallows entering below a certain Dose that you'd like to access. We *think* you will have to calculate the actual exposure yourself, and calibrate your exposure with this filter enabled.


### Greyscale BMP
Accepts 4-bit up to 24-bit bitmap files, although 8-bit gives the full greyscale range (256 grey values). BMP Greyscale files tends to quickly hit the filesize limit of the software, so only works for smaller than wafer-scale litho (eg. ~2cm areas). If you need to expose a larger area, such as a full wafer, you need to use DXF format, below. 
### Greyscale DXF
Each grey-level should be on a separate layer, where the layer name should be a number corresponding to the grey-level to print (layers numbers/levels #1-255). We recommend using a scripting method such as 
Y-oriented ridges will still be present on the PR due to lateral stitching (approx 7% lower dose on the stitching boundaries - small but will be easily visible due to corresponding PR thickness changes). Post-develop reflow (via hotplate) might be required for smoothing steps, but may also affect the PR profile. 
### Conversion
Greyscale designs must be fully converted at the time the CAD file is imported, so plan to book extra time just for the Design conversion, prior to exposure (depending on design size). 
For small samples (1-2cm), plan something like 30-45min for conversion. 
For full 4-inch wafers with ~50% fill, conversion could take up to 1hr or more. Book tool time accordingly and be sure to communicate with upcoming users to let them know, as the total conversion time is often unknown. 
It is ok to convert the Design in one session and run the Exposure in a separate session. 
During the _Convert_ phase you will choose either DXF Greyscale or BMP Greyscale. You will also set up the **Gray Table** that determines which layers get which grey-value (0-255). The Maximum Grey-Value (255) will get the full Dose chosen in the Exposure Screen, and 0 will get 0mJ Dose. 
### Exposure
The Dose chosen in the _Exposure_ screen will correspond to a grey-value of 255 (in the grey-table chosen during the _Convert_ phase, see above). 
You can run a Series (focus-exposure matrix) with a Grey-scale Design, although the exposure time will be longer, so we suggest to use a minimal working CAD file for this purpose, to minimize exposure time. 
At this time the tool does not support Rotation alignment correction for greyscale litho, only X/Y translation. You can use a 2nd Layer exposure with Alignment, but you must **disable ""Exposee with Substrate Angle"" and/or ""Rotation, Scaling and Shearing""** or the exposure will fail.

MLA150 - Large Image GDS Generation,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Large_Image_GDS_Generation,"How to convert a regular rasterized image (eg. JPG, BMP, PNG etc.) and into a vectorized format (GDS,DXF) compatible with the MLA150. This produces a much smaller file than a raw BMP image, because large-area polygons are created, as opposed to the BMP file defining each ~4µm pixel across a 150mm wafer (which hits the RAM limit on the computer). 
In this example, we convert the image into a 1-bit black-and-white image using the free software 
#### Procedure
  1. In 
    1. open the Image (JPG, PNG, BMP etc.),
    2. Image > Mode > Indexed > 1-bit 
      1. Optional: Dither to handle grey values (haven't tried this).
    3. Can edit by painting etc.
    4. Save as any JPG, PNG, BMP format
  2. In 
    1. Open the Image file, default options
    2. Click on the Image with the Arrow tool, to select it.
    3. Path > Trace Bitmap (options affect curves/resolution)
    4. Use the “Update” button to show a Preview of the Path that will be created.
    5. Set the Options: Trace BitMap > Single-Scan > AutoTrace (dropdown menu). 
    6. [OK] to create the Path, then Close the “Trace Bitmap” window.
    7. Creates a new Path object that outlines the image
    8. Use the Arrow select tool to select the Image 
      1. Bottom status bar shows what object is selected
      2. Option/Alt-Click to select obscured objects
      3. Make sure PATH is _Not_ selected
    9. Delete the Image object. File should now have only the Path object in it.
    10. File > Save a Copy… > DXF (Autocad R14)
    11. UNCHECK ""Robo"" and ""LWPOLYLINE"" - important, or the lines won’t be connected as a single object.
    12. You now have a DXF vector file of the image.
  3. In 
    1. Open the DXF in Klayout
    2. Use Cell Instance to scale up to desired size: 
      1. Create a new Cell
      2. Instance the original Cell into that.
      3. Edit Cell Instance properties to adjust scaling
    3. Use Move tool to Center image at 0,0
    4. Save as GDS
    5. Change file extension to _lower case_ “gds” important, or MLA _convert_ software won’t see the file.
    6. Take note of which Cell & Layer should be printed
  4. On the **[MLA](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Maskless_Aligner_\(Heidelberg_MLA150\) ""Maskless Aligner \(Heidelberg MLA150\)""):** load for exposure 
    1. [Convert Design] and Import the GDS,
    2. Choose correct Cell from dropdown for ""GDS Structure""
    3. Set correct Layer: set 1st line to correct layer & uncheck the others
    4. [Viewer] to make sure scale is correct
    5. Ready to expose the pattern as normal.

## Unexpected Behavior
  * If the software is acting unusual (eg. black screen), or stage is moving to an incorrect location, or _Convert_ software unable to launch, it could be due to the computer running out of RAM memory. 
    * A computer restart typically resolves this. Run the [**restart procedure**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Rebooting_the_Computer) further down this page to resolve.
  * If you're seeing unexpected stopping of the exposure, either right at the beginning of the exposure, or in the middle (after clicking _[Start Exposure]_), then the Design file may have become corrupted. Designs are prone to corruption if aborted partway through an exposure/conversion. 
    * Re-import your original GDS/BMP/DXF file in the _[Convert Design]_ screen to try to resolve this.


## Out Of Focus Exposures
After developing, you find that some of all of your pattern is extremely out of focus. Small features (less than ~100µm) don't show up at all, and large features are extremely rounded, sometimes with rainbows at the PR edges indicating extremely slanted photoresist. 
[![Image showing CAD and corresponding Microscope image. Microscope features are severely rounded.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/7/7b/Out_of_Focus_Exposures_-_Carl_Peterson_%28Krisnamoorthy_Group%2C_2021-12%29.png/460px-Out_of_Focus_Exposures_-_Carl_Peterson_%28Krisnamoorthy_Group%2C_2021-12%29.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Out_of_Focus_Exposures_-_Carl_Peterson_\(Krisnamoorthy_Group,_2021-12\).png)Example of an out-of-focus exposure. Features <100µm do not resolve. (Courtesy Carl Peterson, Dec. 2021)
### Causes
There are multiple possible causes for this issue:, all of which have to do with the Optical Autofocus' confocal surface detection: 
  1. The Optical AutoFocus laser is starting the write on an extremely non-uniform part of the photoresist spin (eg. corner of quarter-wafer), which causes it to drive out of focus before the write starts.
  2. The Optical Autofocus driving off/onto a round wafer can also cause it to go out of focus during the write, with no warnings (it'll keep exposing).
  3. Very dark (low reflection) areas of the wafer can also cause the OptAF surface detection to lose signal, and lose the feedback signal needed to maintain focus during a write.


### Solutions for all substrate types
For Samples that are less than ~1 or 2 inches, try the following methods (listed with most effective first): 
  1. Before starting the exposure: **Enable the Low/High Mag microscope** (NOT Overview camera), and **move the scope to a “good”/uniform region** of the sample before hitting [Start Exposure]. Make sure the sample features (or dirt/defects) are in-focus, indicating that the OptAF is correctly tracking the surface. The system will perform an initial re-focus in this location right before beginning the exposure.
  2. Make sure the High/Low Res (not overview) camera is on a uniform area of the sample before hitting [Start Exposure].
  3. Make sure the ORIGIN (0,0) coordinate of your CAD file is placed in a relatively uniform area of your sample. Do not place the Origin at the corner or on PR edge-bead, as the Optical AF laser may do an initial measurement at this location. If you are trying to align your die to a corner, use [_this technique instead_](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Aligning_to_a_quarter-wafer).
  4. Remove thick photoresist edge-bead prior to exposure (eg. with razor blade, or a little EBR100 on a cotton swab). Some edge-bead removal techniques: [Photolithography - Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photolithography_-_Manual_Edge-Bead_Removal_Techniques ""Photolithography - Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques"")


### Solution for 3-4 inch wafers
  * Adjust your design/CAD file so the design is about ≥10mm from the edges of the wafer (in the Y direction especially) has been reported to help. The write-head overtravels past the CAD design by ~8-9mm, so this can prevent the head from hitting the PR edge-bead/wafer-edge (the cause of focus-loss).
  * Try removing the edge-bead of your PR: [Photolithography - Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photolithography_-_Manual_Edge-Bead_Removal_Techniques ""Photolithography - Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques"")
  * For large substrates, switching to Pneumatic Autofocus works well (although focus repeatabiity is less stable, eg. focus shifts by ±5 over a few weeks). PneuAF causes a few-mm of edge-bead area to expose out-of-focus, which is acceptable for full-wafers, but often too large exclusion for smaller samples. 
    * Contact the supervisor for info on switching to Pneumatic AF. _**Do NOT use PneuAF without first asking Staff!**_ There is significant _**crash**_ potential if performed incorrectly.
    * PneuAF will usually have a slightly different defocus offset compared to OptAF. You should run a new FEM/Series with PneAF.
    * PneuAF will require Focus/Exposure calibration (in Series mode) more often than OptAF.


### Debugging
After exposure, open the logfile for your Job (see [this tip for logfile location](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Exposure_Logs_.2F_Reports)) and search for the word ""_piezo_ "". This records the Z-height Piezo position - the physical autofocus position - at the end/start of each stripe (when the optical head changes direction, off the substrate). Since the piezo freezes motion off the substrate, this value indicates the autofocus piezo height at the edge of your substrate. 
When in-focus on your substrate this should be in the range ~28,000 to 51,000 or so. If you see a value significantly outside of this range, then this usually means the autofocus drove to it's limit, because it was not tracking the substrate surface. Sometimes the first one or two stripes are in-focus, and then the rest are out of focus. Other times, the system is out of focus from the start, and stays this way for the entire exposure. 
You can see the optical autofocus laser position in the camera, it is about 6µm up-left from the central crosshair. It is a confocal surface detection, which continuously tracks the surface – even while manually driving around the substrate before exposure. When this laser hits a bad point (eg. black /dark no reflection, or particle, or steep slope) it can lose surface tracking. During substrate load, the system attempts to land on the surface using this system. 
Before exposure, if you see your surface is far out of focus, then your exposure will likely also be out of focus (the same continuous AutoFocus is active during microscope imaging). 
  * Try un/re-loading the substrate, and alter the substrate position
  * Make sure there are no black/very dark spots on the substrate which would cause the system to be unable to optically detect the surface
  * For transparent, thin substrates, try switching to blanket deposition and etching (instead of liftoff), to provide an opaque surface
  * If nothing else works, use contact alignment with a photomask.


## ""Autofocus is not working properly""
### Symptom
When you click ""Start Exposure"", the system pops an error saying ""_**The Optical Autofocus is not Working Properly: [OK] [Cancel]**_ "" 
In addition, right before exposure you might see the substrate is out of focus, of the Optical Autofocus Spot is not visible (possibly indicating the substrate is out of focus). 
### Remedies
  1. The most common issue is that you did not measure and _type in your substrate's thickness into the Substrate Template_. 
    1. If you ""guessed' on the substrate thickness, your guess was not close enough
    2. Use the drop gauge by the tool to more accurately measure the thickness of your substrate - possibly measuring a few points, and type in the average into the Substrate Template.
  2. Something on the back of your wafer is significantly altering the focus on the top surface. 
    1. For example, very thick photoresist can cause this, if it gets on the back of your wafer.
    2. Use a razor blade or AZ EBR to remove photoresist on the back of the wafer.
    3. Check for Particles on the wafer stage and the back of your wafer.


You may also optionally [remove the edge-bead (link to procedure)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photolithography_-_Manual_Edge-Bead_Removal_Techniques#EBR100_Swabbing ""Photolithography - Manual Edge-Bead Removal Techniques"") around the edge of the wafer to reduce focus issues. 
## Exposure Logs / Reports
  *     * You can find a detailed log file of each exposure in the folder `C:\HIMT\LogFiles\ExposureLogs`. At the end of this file you can find final statistics from Field (Local) Alignment. You can copy the appropriate log file into your Nanofiles user folder to make it accessible via FTP.
    * If you run into an unusual error, please let us know the Job Name, so that we can locate this log file if needed.


## Stitching
The system raster scans the ~12x20µm exposure fields across the wafer, and there will be stitching errors at the boundaries. 
The ""fast-scan"" axis is in ±Y, which causes the largest stitching errors to show up as Y-oriented stripes, ridges or bumps, every ~20µm in X. We estimate that these ridges indicate about 4-7% lower dose at the stitching boundary. 
When you are fully-exposing your PR (typically with a bit of over-exposure, eg. ~20% overdose), these stitching boundaries are barely visible, if at all, and typically correspond to a ~50nm bump in the feature. 
However for partially-exposed PR (such as in grey-scale exposure), these ridges will clearly manifest as Y-oriented ridges of ~4-7% lower exposure dose, and reduced underexposed PR. 
[![SEM of horizontal/vertical 400nm line/space](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/83/MLA150_-_160D0F15_stitching_notch_-_01.jpg/300px-MLA150_-_160D0F15_stitching_notch_-_01.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MLA150_-_160D0F15_stitching_notch_-_01.jpg)MLA150 stitching example - ~500nm line/space in positive PR, showing 50nm bumps oriented in Y-direction due stitching.
  
Overexposing the design can reduce the size of these stitching bumps. Since that will also alter your feature size on-wafer, you can us the _Convert_ correction ""CD Bias"" to correct your feature sizes accordingly, see [this page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Design_Guidelines#High-Resolution_Writing ""MLA150 - Design Guidelines"") for more info on using that option. Or just adjust your exposure CAD file feature sizes accordingly. 
## Stage not centered during [Substrate Load]
When the system moves the stage to place your sample under the lens, the center of the stage is **not under the lens!**
**__WARNING__** : _**Do NOT continue**_ if this occurs - there is significant danger of crashing the lens into a sample. 
  * _**Cancel**_ the substrate load process.


### Workaround
  * In the software Menu, choose **Tools > Initialize Stage**, then retry your Job.
  * If that does not solve the problem, please [**reboot the computer (instructions below)**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Rebooting_the_Computer), which will also reinitialize all motor controllers.


Note: if you chose a “Small” substrate template, the system always moves the sample under the **overview camera** at first, which is the the Left of the main write head. You’ll see the yellow microscope illumination around your sample. This is normal behavior. 
## Defocus: unable to enter ±25 full range
In the _Setup_ screen, Editors for Resist or Series templates, you are limited to only ±10 defocus, even though the system is capable of ±25. 
### Workaround
  1. During Job _Setup_ , make sure to choose ""_**_General-Focus**_ "". User-made Resist templates usually won't have the setting correctly applied, unless they copied a Staff resist.
  2. In the _Exposure_ screen - after wafer load etc. - you may still edit the defocus range, and in this screen you are able to type in the full range ±25. For a Series exposure (focus-exposure matrix, FEM), you can choose the ""_Manual"" template during _Setup_ , and on the _Expose_ screen you can edit the Series array to your needs with full defocus range.


## Convert software is unable to launch
  1. Check whether the XWindows software is available in the Windows Start bar - sometimes the window lands behind the MLAMenu software.
  2. If an error window is indicating some error with launching convert, then perform the [**computer reboot procedure**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Rebooting_the_Computer) below.


## Focus Depth Motor Not Initialized
After an exposure has been initiated, but before exposure has actually begun, you get an error window stating the the ""Focal Depth Motor is not initialized."" 
**Notify staff**
We can reinitialize that motor remotely, which will allow you to start your exposure. 
## Nanofiles folder not showing up on SFTP
**Problem:** When you log into the Nanofiles FTP server, you don't see an ""MLA_Heidelberg"" folder to upload your CAD files. 
**Reason:** After your user's folder is created in the Users_Nanofiles folder on the MLA computer, our FTP server only creates the corresponding folder on the Nanofiles FTP site once per day around 00:00 midnight. 
Wait until the next morning and your folder should be available. If you need immediate access, please email the tool supervisors, and one of us can upload your file into our Staff folder on the tool. 
You can find more troubleshooting info about the Nanofiles FTP at the corresponding [Frequently Asked Questions section](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_get_my_files_from_the_NanoFab_computers.3F ""Frequently Asked Questions""). 
## Aligning to a quarter-wafer/irregular piece
For alignment of your die to a quarter-wafer, one accurate method for accounting for both rotation and die placement is to 
use 2nd Layer / Manual Alignment with 2 coordinates to align to the wafer's flat edge. 
[![schematic of aligning to a quarter-wafer, using manual alignment](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/98/MLA_Quarter-Wafer_Alignment.jpg/500px-MLA_Quarter-Wafer_Alignment.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MLA_Quarter-Wafer_Alignment.jpg)Using Manual Alignment to align your CAD file to a quarter-wafer.
Detailed procedure is as follows: 
  1. **Set up your** **CAD file** with a mock-up of the quarter wafer on a construction Layer, and align your die (on a production Layer) to this. The quarter-wafer should have a _flat_ edge ""down"" (negative Y).
  2. Make sure the **Origin (0,0)** of your CAD file is in a uniform region of your quarter wafer- ie. _not_ on the edge/edge-bead/non-uniform photoresist.
  3. Determine **coordinates** to two points along the the Bottom edge of the quarter-wafer.
  4. On the MLA, use **""2nd layer"" exposure** , enabling alignment.
  5. Use the **""Rectangular"" substrate template** (Usually ""_**_Rectangular_OptAF**_ "")
  6. **Load** your quarter-wafer according to your CAD file, with a flat-edge ""down"" (–Y).
  7. Type in the **two** **coordinates** to the pretend alignment marks along the wafer bottom.
  8. On the **[Alignment]** screen, click **[Move to First Mark]**
  9. If you need to move the stage to see the wafer edge, move _only_ in Y (up/down), don't move left/right. If you make a mistake, click **[Move to First Mark]** again.
  10. Change the Alignment dropdown list from ""CrossAlignment"" --> ""**Manual** ""
  11. Choose **High** or **Low** magnification on the microscope. (High will be more accurate.)
  12. Click **[Measure]** , and the system will ask you to click on the alignment mark on the video window.
  13. **Click on the wafer edge** , but directly above/below the screen's central crosshair - so we're only correcting the Y-coordinate. The mouse crosshair's Y-axis should line up with the screen's central crosshair.
  14. Click **[Accept]** , and the system will move to the 2nd mark coordinate.
  15. **Repeat** with the second location on the wafer edge, correcting only the Y-position.
  16. On the **[Exposure]** screen, **Disable** ""Scaling"" and ""Shearing"", and **Enable ""Rotation""**. The CAD file's origin should be accurately placed in the center of the schematic, and aligned to the wafer edge.
  17. Proceed with exposure as normal (setting Dose/Defocus and [Expose]).

## Misalignment
Inadequate alignment between pervious and current lithography layers requires some additional investigation. 
First, pay attention to the calculated alignment corrections. 
After alignment, the _[Exposure]_ screen will show calculated values for: 
  * Rotation : [√] enabled by default.
  * Scaling [_]: **dis** abled by default
  * Shearing [_]: **dis** abled by default


Observe the calculated values of Scaling and Shearing (angle between X & Y axes) after alignment. 
  * Scaling (aka. magnification) errors will manifest as a walk-off as you get further away from some point (eg. substrate center). 
    * If Scaling shows a value far away from 1.000, but you left the checkbox disabled, the magnification was _not_ corrected during exposure.
    * The walk-off will be larger for larger substrates/patterns.
    * You can calculate how much misalignment you will get for some magnification error, for example:
    * 1.000 100 (aka. 100 
    * Typical scaling that does not require correction will be within ~10ppm (0.999 990 to 1.000 010).
  * Shearing (angle between X & Y axes) will manifest as an angle-based walk-off. We have never yet seen this issue.


Adding more alignment marks, spaced further apart, allows for better curve-fitting and statistics when the software calculates these values in Global alignment modes. 
### Alignment Matching between Litho Tools
Note that it is common and _expected_ that different lithography systems will have some mismatch between their scaling & orthogonality calibrations - but those can be corrected out by enabling the above checkboxes and measuring more high-quality marks. This is called ""matching"" the alignment between different machines. 
### Analyzing misalignment
It is recommended that you include [Vernier alignment](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities#General_CAD_files_for_Lithography ""Calculators + Utilities"") patterns between layers to measure misalignment using the microscopes. 
To understand the origin/mechanism of misalignment you are experiencing, it is recommended to plot the **misalignment versus wafer location** - this often elucidates the solution; 
Draw a small arrow indicating the direction of misalignment. For example, if 2nd layer is misaligned by (-2µm , 0µm) then you draw an arrow pointing left ← at that wafer location. 
For example: 
[![screenshot showing misalignment versus wafer location, with arrows indicating misalignment direction](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/6/62/MLA150_Alignment_versus_Wafer_Location_v1.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MLA150_Alignment_versus_Wafer_Location_v1.jpg)Example of misalignment analysis. Arrows indicate direction of misalignment at each ensured location. In this case the arrows clearly indicate the cause error is due to Magnification/Scaling, not X/Y shift.
### Die-to-Die Alignment
If analyzing the misalignment doesn't fix your alignment issue (or you can't figure out what is causing it), then you can run ""die-to-die"" alignment, aka. ""local alignment"" (GCA parlance), referred to as ""Field alignment"" on the MLA software. 
This requires that every die has an automatic alignment mark (typically a cross), and that your CAD file is of a single die. 
The system will still perform global alignment to the wafer to get ""close"" to each die, but after that, will re-align each die right before exposure, and will expose only a single die at a time. 
This significantly increases exposure time. 
Please see the ""Field alignment"" section of the [Operating procedure](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Maskless_Aligner_\(Heidelberg_MLA150\)#Operating_Procedures ""Maskless Aligner \(Heidelberg MLA150\)"") for detailed instructions.

## Greyscale Lithography Limitations
The MLA150 does have grey-scale patterning capabilities, but has some limitations & workarounds that we have identified. Please see this page for the [Greyscale limitations and design guidelines.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Design_Guidelines#Limitations_.26_Workarounds ""MLA150 - Design Guidelines"")
## Rebooting the Computer
Restarting the computer can resolve errors due to the system running out of memory (RAM), force the reinitialization & homing of motors, and reinitialize the _convert_ virtual machine. 
#### Restart Procedure
  * In the MLAMenu (main) software, go to File > Exit. 
    * It takes a minute or so to close everything. It will also close the camera viewer (SharkVision).
  * Reboot the computer via Windows Start > Power > Restart 
    * It takes a few mins for the computer to reboot.
  * On the Windows login screen (Looks like ""Heidelberg instruments"" background), start typing to log in. Login info is written at the computer.
  * After logging back in, wait ~1 min until the 2 icons appear next to the Time in the start bar. (SiiPlus and XMing)
  * Then launch MLAMenu.exe, wait ~1 min until it has completed initializing.
  * Make sure the ""Hardware"" section of the software shows all components as ""OK"" or ""Initialized""

## General Procedure
  1. Make your CAD file of your device according to the tool you're going to do litho on.
  2. Make separate ""Layers"" on your CAD file corresponding to each litho.
  3. Fill out the Mask Order Form for the photomask vendor you choose to order from. Can order all photomasks (one for each Layer) in one order, calling out separate CAD Layers for each Mask. 
    1. Academic users: Contact [Demis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for quotes from photomask vendors.
    2. Industrial users: Contact photomask vendors for quotes, we can suggest some or you can find them online yourself.
  4. UCSB Users: Submit a requisition in Procurement Gateway to send a PO to the photomask vendor.
  5. Send Photomask vendor your CAD file and Mask order form (referencing above PO).
  6. Industrial Users: You can pay by credit card if desired.
  7. Typically ~3 days to receive the photomasks.


## Generic Contact Mask Parameters
For the contact aligner you are designing for, make sure you know the following specifications: 
### Mask Plate Size
  * We have two different styles of contact aligners and each has it's own capability in regard to the substrate and mask size it can accommodate (with some overlap between the two). 
    * SUSS MJB-3: 
      * Wafer size: 3"" max. for vacuum mode; 4” for soft contact (3” x 3” exposure area)
      * Substrate size: 3"" x 3"" max
      * Mask plate size: 3"" x 3"" x 0.090"" or 4"" x 4"" x 0.090"", typically soda-lime glass.
    * SUSS MA-6: 
      * Chuck Sizes: 
        * 1"" square (or wafer) and smaller, backside alignment capability
        * 3"" wafer, no backside alignment
        * 4"" wafer, backside alignment capability
        * 6"" wafer, backside alignment capability
      * Mask Holder Sizes: 
        * 3""
        * 4""
        * 5"" mask - can be modified to support a 6"" mask but exposure area will still be ~4"" diameter (see Staff)
        * 7""
  * The plate size should be ~1"" larger than your wafer size, AND the contact aligner should have a plate holder compatible with that plate size. Some examples: 
    * To expose a **2"" (50mm) wafer, or _smaller pieces_** you could order 
      * A 3 "" or 4"" mask plate. Eg. 3 _x 3 x 0.090 inch soda lime_ _glass._
        * Either put your design in the center of the plate, and order multiple plates (one for each process step/""Layer""), or
        * Put multiple patterns on a single plate and use the offset-vacuum chuck, to put your sample under the right pattern on the plate. (This takes a bit more experience with the MJB to design correctly.)
    * To expose a **3"" (75mm) wafer** , you could order 
      * A 4"" or 5"" mask plate. Eg. _5 x 5 x 0.090 inch soda lime_ _glass._
    * To expose a **4"" (100mm) wafer** , you should order 
      * 5"" mask plate. Eg. _5 x 5 x 0.090 inch soda lime_ _glass._
      * This works on the [MA6](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Aligner_\(SUSS_MA-6\) ""Contact Aligner \(SUSS MA-6\)"") only.
    * To expose a **6"" (150mm) wafer** , you should order 
      * 7"" mask plate. Eg. _7 x 7 x 0.090 inch soda lime_ _glass._
      * This works on the [MA6](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Aligner_\(SUSS_MA-6\) ""Contact Aligner \(SUSS MA-6\)"") only.


  * Either the quoted product number from our photomask vendor quotes, or the minimum feature size in your CAD - and just ask the photomask vendor which product number to use.


### Other Mask Plate Specs
For all contact plates, we suggest the following standard params: 
  * Material: Soda Lime glass (quartz is generally overkill)
  * Thickness 0.090"" (eg. _5"" x 5"" x 0.090""_ or _4"" x 4"" x 0.090""_)
  * Orientation/Mirroring should be ""_Right Reading with Chrome Down_ "" if your CAD file shows exactly what you want on your wafer. 
    * For _Back side alignment_ , don't forget to mirror your pattern horizontally/over the Y-axis (since your wafer will be flipped).
  * You can choose whether the polygons you draw are transparent glass (""objects are clear"") or opaque chrome (""objects are dark""). You must consider whether you are using a positive or negative resist.


Ask the tool's Process Expert or Tool Supervisor to confirm these values. You can send your draft order form and CAD file to the tool super/process expert for review. 
## Definitions for Mask/Reticle Order Form
When submitting the photo mask order, the following notes & definitions apply: 
  1. ""**Grade** "" or ""**Product Code** "" will be one of the items on our quote. This will specify the glass type (soda-lime or quartz), plate size (4"" square and 0.090"" thick, for example), and the resolution. The grade choice determines the price, and is chosen based on required feature size (smaller feature size is more expensive). This is found on the vendor's quote, or you ask the vendor for a price based on desired minimum feature size (smallest feature actually present on your CAD file). 
    1. Although you will submit your CAD file at 1x wafer scale, the actual reticle is printer larger by the stepper's magnification (eg. 4x or 5x mag, depending on the stepper system), so make sure to choose your reticle grade accounting for this; eg. If my CAD has 1.0µm lines smallest feature, I should choose a photomask grade better/equal to 4.0µm for a stepper with 4x reduction.
  2. ""**Title** "" or ""**Device Name** "" or ""Layer Title"" - any text of your choosing, to identify this ""set"" of multiple mask plates (""Device Name"") and each individual mask plate of the set (""Layer title""). 
    1. Eg. ""Device"" is ""_DFB Laser 2025-01_ ""
    2. ""Layer Titles"" may be ""_Mesa etch_ "", ""_Contact pads_ "" and ""_Gratings_ "" etc.
    3. The mask plates will show both, eg. one plate will show ""_DFB Laser 2025-01: Mesa Etch_ "" and another will have """"_DFB Laser 2025-01: Gratings_ "", printed on the edge of the plates.
  3. “**GDS Level** ” is also known as “**layer number** ” - the GDS Layer number to print, from your CAD file 
    1. If you are printing multiple mask plates for separate device Layers, you can submit one CAD file with each Layer on a separate GDS Layer, and specify each GDS Layer number as a separate plate (with it's own Title text, polarity, grade/CD etc.) on the Order form (on it's own line).
  4. ""**topcell** "" or ""**structure name** "" is the Cell in your CAD file that contains the hierarchy of patterns to print.
  5. Polarity/Mirroring should be ""**Right-Reading (legible text) with Chrome Down** "", if your CAD is exactly what you want on the wafer, for all our systems.
  6. “**Min. Feature on Mask** ” refers to minimum clear or opaque feature, assuming features similar to lines/spaces. This should be specified at the reticle-scale - see ""Grade"" above.
  7. “**Min. Contact** ” refers to features with aspect ratio close to 1:1, eg. Squares and circles. These have a separate spec due to the manufacturing process, so make sure to choose the appropriate grade of photomask with this in mind.
  8. “**CD** ”, or ""**Critical Dimension** "" - Choose a CD similar to your most critical feature (scaled to the reticle scale), so the vendor will print & measure & guarantee test structures at that exact size.


## Generic Mask design/programming CAD files & spreadsheets
  * Example [Toppan Order Form via Digidat](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/images/9/90/Digidat-Toppan_Mask_order_form_%28UCSB_ASML_5500%29.docx)
    * Academic users may request the UCSB Nanofab's quotes from various photomask vendors.
  * On-wafer alignment marks: You will need matching male+female alignment marks to match each mask plate to on-wafer layers. You can use any alignment mark design you want - some examples are linked below.

  * [CAD Design Tips](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities#CAD_Design_Tips ""Calculators + Utilities"")


## CAD Tips
  * By default, Wafer flat is Down (–Y) with respect to your CAD file for most systems.
  * Utilize the ""Cell"" and ""Cell Instancing"" functionality in your CAD layout program! (aka. a ""Block"" in AutoCAD). Highly recommended to use KLayout, not AutoCAD. See [Calculators + Utilities > CAD Design Tips](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities#CAD_Design_Tips ""Calculators + Utilities"") for tutorials.
  * Center your entire design around the coordinates (0,0). (0,0) should always be the center of your device, wafer and/or photomask/reticle Cells. Photomask vendors can then NOT ""auto center"" your designs on the plate.
  * Inside each sub-Cell, also design around the cell's (0,0) origin.
  * Create a Cell called ""_reticle_layout_ "" or similar, that is an exact representation of what the printed reticle patterns should look like (typically at 1x wafer-scale, if _not_ including the outer templates for the stepper system). Instance the Device's Cells into _reticle_layout_ , and reference this Cell on your mask order form. (You can also Instance the same cells into ""_device_layout_ "" and ""_wafer_layout_ "" cells during design/verification.).


### First Layer Alignment
  * To align your first layer, when there are no alignment marks on your wafer, it is very helpful to leave CLEAR/transparent open areas around the wafer to allow you to see the outer edges of your wafer/sample for coarse alignment to the pattern. Example below:[![CAD file screenshot of example of layer 1 alignemnt to wafer](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/31/Contact_Layer_1_alignment_example_v1.png/300px-Contact_Layer_1_alignment_example_v1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Contact_Layer_1_alignment_example_v1.png)Example of transparent ring on mask plate for first layer alignment.However, make sure to consider the process implications for the fact that photoresist on this outer ring will be exposed during exposure (ie. may get developed out or hardened, depending on positive/negative photoresist).

## About
The MLA150 allows for arbitrary direct-write patterning of I-Line photoresists from an uploaded CAD drawing/file (GDS, DXF, CIF etc.). The system uses a 
Depending on the exposure options and write area, the MLA is able to expose a 100mm wafer in about 30min, and achieves minimum features sizes around 0.5µm, with overlay/alignment accuracy better than 200nm. 
The system has a continuous, automatic autofocus, using optical and pneumatic detection of the substrate surface. 
The software allows for custom drawings and alignment marks to be exposed onto any feature located on the microscope. 
Greyscale lithography allows for photoresist profiles with repeatable slanted or tapered structures, via an 8-bit greyscale bitmap or layer-structured DXF file. See the [Greyscale Limitations page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Greyscale_Lithography_Limitations ""MLA150 - Troubleshooting"") for more info. 
The high-aspect ratio (variable/long focal length) option enables vertical sidewalls on very thick (~100µm) photoresists.

Photolithography Recipes for the [Heidelberg MLA150](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Maskless_Aligner_\(Heidelberg_MLA150\) ""Maskless Aligner \(Heidelberg MLA150\)""). All recipes were characterized on blank Silicon wafers. For different substrate coatings/materials, you will likely need to run a focus-exposure matrix (""series"" exposure mode), using our params as a starting point. 
These recipes use the same spin and bake params as our contact aligner and stepper recipes, using built-in hotplates on the photoresist spinner benches. 
_**Any I-Line PR is usable**_ , although we only characterized a select few below. Run your own Focus-Exposure Matrix to characterize a new PR. 
**_Note:_** On this tool, it is common to have to run a Focus-Exposure Matrix (aka. FEM), via ""_Series_ "" exposure mode, for each new layer structure and/or critical feature size. The layer structure can strongly affect the exposure parameters. See the [FEM Analysis Tips page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ASML_Stepper_3_Standard_Operating_Procedure#Tips_for_FEM_analysis ""ASML Stepper 3 Standard Operating Procedure"") for how to choose the proper exposure parameters. 
The [**MLA** **Troubleshooting > Out-of-Focus Exposures**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Troubleshooting#Out_Of_Focus_Exposures ""MLA150 - Troubleshooting"") section can help you avoid bad exposures, please read it! 
### Positive Resist (MLA150)
_We found that positive PR's worked well with the 405nm laser - the 375nm laser would likely also work. Sub-micron features are possible. Overexposure is recommended to avoid stitching and horiz/vert discrepancies; compensate for widening/narrowing using CD Bias[as described here](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/MLA150_-_Design_Guidelines#High-Resolution_Writing ""MLA150 - Design Guidelines"")._
Note: calibrations done with the ""HIMT design"" will show higher dose, due to using only dark-field line/space patterns.

| Notes on SPR 220-7 Greyscale: Rehydration after exposure is necessary, to prevent bubbles at PEB. Stitching leaves ridges in Y-direction with ~5% height of removed PR depth. Can be reduced via reflow, but significantly affects PR profile.  Author Credit: Patrick Curtis, 2022 & Biljana Stamenic 2023 & Demis D. John 2023; Please see our [publications policy](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Publications_acknowledging_the_Nanofab ""Frequently Asked Questions"").  
*_Rehydration_ : After exposure, leave sample in lab air (ok to cover in tray, with tinfoil). Allows water vapor in air to diffuse into PR to complete chemical reaction. **_PEB: Post-exposure bake_ : after exposure, before develop  ***_Reflow_ : To smooth out stitching lines.

### Electron Beam Resists Available
EBL Resists are custom-mixed according to user resolution needs - contact [Bill Mitchell](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Bill_Mitchell ""Bill Mitchell"") to get a bottle. 
Currently available at UCSB are: 
  * **PMMA** : (950K in anisole, 950K in MIBK, 495K in anisole, 50K in anisole) 
    * High-resolution positive polymer-based resist with relatively poor sensitivity (resolution scales directly and sensitivity scales inversely with molecular weight);
    * Poor plasma etch resistance, hence used primarily to fabricate metal lines via liftoff processes (via a bi-layer resist scheme...low MW on bottom, high MW on top for single lines, or vice-versa for T-gate fabrication);
    * Utilizes an inert solvent developer (usually MIBK:IPA mixtures)


  * **P(MMA-MAA) copolymer** : (low MW methyl-methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) copolymers in ethyl lactate) 
    * A positive polymer-based resist with poor resolution but with significantly higher sensitivity than the higher MW PMMA resists above
    * Used primarily as the top layer in a bi-layer resist scheme for T-Gate fabrication, and utilizes inert solvent developer (MIBK:IPA mixtures)


  * **CSAR-62** : ZEP-equivalent resist manufactured in Germany at much more competitive pricing! 
    * High-resolution polymer-based positive resist with very good sensitivity and excellent etch resistance
    * Can be used in both metal lift-off processes (slight overexposure results in an excellent undercut profile) and various dry-etch processes for pattern transfer to the underlying substrate
    * Utilizes inert solvent developers (e.g., n-amyl acetate for higher sensitivity and good resolution or MIBK:IPA mixtures for increased LER performance)


  * **maN-2403** : negative polymer-based resist (that is NOT chemically amplified) 
    * Very good resolution (down to the 40-50nm range) and sensitivity
    * Exhibits excellent dry-etch resistance
    * Developed using a dilute basic solution (e.g., metal-ion-free developers such as AZ-300MIF)


  * **HSQ** : negative resist that is based on spin-on glass material (ie, not polymer-based) 
    * Extremely good resolution (features below 10nm can be resolved)
    * Etch resistance is high in Cl-based chemistries since HSQ reduces to a porous SiOx structure after exposure and development
    * Sensitivity and contrast are very dependent on developer solution used and are usually poor 
      * Standard AZ300MIF developer solutions have decent sensitivity (100's of uC/cm2 at 100kV) but extremely poor contrast
      * Stronger (and toxic!) 25%TMAH solutions have much better contrast but poor sensitivity (1000's of uC/cm2 at 100kV)
      * ""Salty"" developer solutions using 1wt% NaCl dissolved in either 4wt% NaOH or AZ300MIF solutions have the best contrast but reduce sensitivity significantly (10,000's of uC/cm2 at 100kV)


  * **DUV resists: UV6, UV210 UVN-30** : chemically amplified polymer-based resists 
    * High resolution and excellent sensitivity (clearing doses below 100uC/cm2 at 100kV)
    * UV6 used mostly in optimized t-gate resist structures
    * Developed using a dilute basic solution (e.g., metal-ion-free developers such as AZ-300MIF)
    * Can be ""double exposed"" by [ASML DUV Stepper](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML_DUV\) ""Stepper 3 \(ASML DUV\)"") and EBL. 
      * Recommended to produce ASML alignment marks first for double exposure methods.
    * See ASML litho recipes for datasheets.

## Start Imaging Session
  1. Open the ""AmScope"" software, via Desktop icon or Start-Bar icon: [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cd/AmScope_01_AmScope_Icon.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_01_AmScope_Icon.png)
  2. Set the microscope shutter to use the camera: [![photo of camera shutter on Nikon microscope](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/36/Microscope_4_Nikon_-_camera_shutter_-_IMG_6249_-_right_side_knobs_-_camera_shutter_-_800px.png/224px-Microscope_4_Nikon_-_camera_shutter_-_IMG_6249_-_right_side_knobs_-_camera_shutter_-_800px.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscope_4_Nikon_-_camera_shutter_-_IMG_6249_-_right_side_knobs_-_camera_shutter_-_800px.png)Camera shutter **Open** on Microscope 4 Nikon LS200, diagram showing to pull slider OUT for camera imaging.  

  3. Click the Camera in the software to begin acquiring images in the software:[![screenshot of software showing camera in Camera List](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Amscope_02_annot_camera_link.png/300px-Amscope_02_annot_camera_link.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Amscope_02_annot_camera_link.png)Click the link in the _Camera List_


### Camera Rotation
You _may_ turn the camera to adjust image rotation, but _do _not_ turn the camera more than 90°_, to prevent unscrewing/altering focus. 
You must put the camera back to 0° rotation when done (USB cable at the back). 
## Choosing the Calibration
In order for the software to know which objective you are using, you must choose the appropriately named Calibration from the dropdown lists. (eg. ""5x, 10x, 20x etc.""). Staff have set the software to display the Calibration/Objective name and microscope on the scale bar in the corner of the image. 
There are 2 separate ways to choose the calibration to use. 
### During live imaging
BEFORE snapping the image: 
On the bar right above the image window, use the drop-down menu called **Magnification** , which is used for measuring _live_ images. (This is also available from the top ""Options"" pull down menu). Choose the calibration from this list _during_ live imaging, **before** clicking ""Snap"". 
[![screenshot of top menu bar](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/3a/AmScope_-_02_annot.png/300px-AmScope_-_02_annot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_-_02_annot.png)The Magnification dropdown menu.
#### Capture the Image
Then, when the live image is ready, click **[Snap]** to capture an image. This image retains internal knowledge of which calibration was used during the capture, and is loaded into a new Tab. 
### After Image Capture
To change the calibration applied on an image that has already been captured, use the top menu bar item: 
Menu ""**Image** "" > ""**Resolution** "". Choose the correct calibration setting for the objective lens you were using and you will now have calibrated measurements for the still image. 
[![screenshot of popup window](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/94/AmScope_-_06_chose_mic2-150x_annot.png/434px-AmScope_-_06_chose_mic2-150x_annot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_-_06_chose_mic2-150x_annot.png)Menu item **Image > Resolution** popup window with scope calibrations dropdown.
## Saving an Image with Measurements
Perform measurements as desired using the various measurement tools (scale bars, line lengths etc.). 
If you want the measurements saved onto the still image, use the menu item: 
_**Layers** > **Merge to Image...**_ to merge the annotation layer onto the image. This will create a new image tab that has your measurements burned into it, the original editable tab is also still open. 
[![screenshot of menu item layers > Merge](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/90/AmScope_-_Layers_Merge_-_annot.png/300px-AmScope_-_Layers_Merge_-_annot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:AmScope_-_Layers_Merge_-_annot.png)Menu item _**Layers > Merge to Image...**_ to burn the measurements into the image, before saving the image file.
The subsequent ""_**Export options**_ "" window allows you to choose the Font size for the text etc. ""50"" is typical. 
Save your pictures as jpegs as normal with _**File > Save As...**_. 
You can save all open tabs into a folder with automatic naming using **File > Batch Save**. 
## End Session
  1. Set the Camera shutter back to Eyepiece imaging (pushed IN) when done.
  2. Close all your image tabs in AmScope (_**Right-click**_ the ""Live"" tab and choose ""_**Close all but this**_ ""), or just close the software.

## About
The Molecular Vapor deposition system is used for deposition of a monolayer-thick fluorocarbon film for producing extremely hydrophobic surfaces used for anti-sticking layers for nanoimprinting or anti-stiction layers for MEMS. The system has integrated Oxygen plasma cleaning for organic removal and surface activation and can be run at temperatures up to 80°C. Multi-step recipes can be created. The system is currently configured for FDTS (perflourodecyltricholorsilane) and water to producing the coatings. Up to 6” wafers can be coated in the system.

# About
The Nanonex NX2000 is a nanoimprinting system that allows for direct pattern transfer from a pre-fabricated master mold into an underlying polymer material. Lateral feature sizes down to less than 10 nm have been demonstrated on this tool. The system can do thermal imprinting into a polymer at temperatures up to 200°C and chamber pressures up to 600 psi. The system can also imprint into and cure UV-cureable materials on top of underlayer polymers in order to planarize samples and provide for high aspect ratio imprint lithography. Since the system uses no rigid plates, but air pressure only, the pressure uniformity is excellent in the system. The heating and cooling rates are as high as 300°C/min. Several types of resists are supplied, including [NXR-1020](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/3/3f/NXR-1020-Datasheet.pdf ""NXR-1020-Datasheet.pdf""), [mr-l-7020](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/9/9d/Mr-l-7000-Imprint-Polymer.pdf ""Mr-l-7000-Imprint-Polymer.pdf""), and [MR-UVCur21](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/f/f9/Mr-UVCur21.pdf ""Mr-UVCur21.pdf""). The system is capable of handling piece parts up to 100 mm wafers. An additional alignment system is also available for 100 mm wafers for aligned imprinting. Non-stick coatings for master molds are deposited using FDTS in the [Molecular Vapor Deposition](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Molecular_Vapor_Deposition ""Molecular Vapor Deposition"") system. For creation of master molds, please call for a discussion of our other capabilities, including electron-beam lithography.

## About
This is a Plasma-Therm model 790 plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system for depositing SiO2, Si3N4, or SiOxNy dielectric films. The system uses a capacitively-coupled 13.56 MHz source excitation to produce the plasma between two parallel aluminum plates. The gas is injected over the sample through a 6” diameter showerhead. The samples are placed on the system anode (to minimize ion damage) which is heated to 250-350°C. SiO2 is produced from SiH4/He 2%/98% and N2O at 250°C. The typical deposition rate is 400 A/min. at 300 mT pressure. The typical BOE etch rate of this oxide is about 400 nm/min. Si3N4 is produced from SiH4/He 2%/98% and NH3 at 250°C or 350°C. The more dense films are produced at 350°C. The stress of the nitride can be altered by adjusting the N2:He ratio of the deposition. CF4/O2 plasmas are used to clean the chamber between depositions. 
These films are typically used for capacitor dielectrics, chemical passivation layers, electrical insulators, reactive ion etching masks, and optical anti-reflective coatings. The system is fully programmable with windows-based software and has a wide array of pre-defined thicknesses. Custom programs for dielectric stacks or different process parameters can be written and saved. 
## Detailed Specifications
  * Gases used: NH3, N2O, 2%SiH4/He, N2,CF4 and O2
  * ~ 10mT ultimate chamber pressure
  * 13.56 Mhz excitation freq.
  * Sample size: pieces to 6” wafers

## Cleaning Recipes (PECVD #1)
The cleaning procedure is very important in order to have consistent result on this tool and also to keep particulate count low. After each deposition you should clean the tool following instructions carefully. The clean is done in two steps: 
  1. Wet cleaning (start cleaning by using a cleanroom wipe sprayed with DI. Wipe chamber sidewalls with it. Finish cleaning by using the cleanroom wipe sprayed with IPA. )
  2. Load the recipe for cleaning ""CF4/O2 Clean"" (edit the recipe and change ONLY time of cleaning). Follow instructions regarding a required time for cleaning.

## Cleaning Recipes (PECVD #2)
### Cleaning Procedure (PECVD#2)
The cleaning procedure is very important in order to have consistent result on this tool and also to keep particulate count low. After each deposition you should clean the tool following instructions carefully. The clean is done in two steps: 
  1. (If >29min dep time) Wet cleaning: Start cleaning by using a cleanroom wipe sprayed with DI. Wipe upper chamber sidewalls with it. Finish cleaning by using the cleanroom wipe sprayed with IPA & wiping again.
  2. Load the recipe for cleaning ""STD CF4/O2 Clean"" (edit the recipe and change ONLY time of cleaning). Follow instructions regarding required time for cleaning.

2020-02: New recipes have been characterized for low particulate count and repeatability.  Only staff-supplied recipes are allowed in the tool. Please follow the [**new procedures**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ICP-PECVD_\(Unaxis_VLR\)#Documentation ""ICP-PECVD \(Unaxis VLR\)"") to ensure low particle counts in the chamber.

```
```
The system currently has **Deuterated Silane (SiD4) installed** - identical to the regular Silicon precursor SiH4, except that it significantly lowers optical absorption in the near-infrared due to shifted molecular vibrations/molecular weights.

## Standard Cleaning Procedure (PECVD #1)
The cleaning procedure is very important in order to have consistent result on this tool and also to keep particulate count low. After each deposition you should clean the tool following instructions carefully. The clean is done in two steps: 
  1. Wet cleaning (start cleaning by using a cleanroom wipe sprayed with DI. Wipe chamber sidewalls with it. Finish cleaning by using the cleanroom wipe sprayed with IPA. )
  2. Load the recipe for cleaning ""CF4/O2 Clean"" (edit the recipe and change ONLY time of cleaning). Follow instructions regarding a required time for cleaning.

## **Do not use the LEXT unless trained first!**
**You MUST be officially trained on this tool before you are allowed to use it!**
**These instructions are a quick-reference for users who have already received the full training.**
## Quick-Start General Procedure
In order to acquire a profile height measurement, you must do the following: 
1) Get the sample surface in focus with the regular “color” optical microscope & lock the focus knob 
2) Switch to “laser” mode & readjust the focus 
3) Specify the bottom and top range for the focus motor to scan over & acquire the scan data (in Fine/Manual mode) 
4) In the “Measure” tab, Specify a region on the image of which to take a profile 
5) Move the cursors to the desired step-height measurement positions 
## Quick-Start Detailed Procedure
### Initial Setup
Make sure microscope is raised and stage is away from the objectives in the “Sample Exchange” position. Make sure software is started (should show a Login screen). If this is not the case, do the following: 
  1. Open the software “ _**OLS4000**_ ”. 
  2. Ensure no sample is inserted, and microscope objectives are lifted away from the stage – use the coarse focus knob to lift the objectives to a safe height & Lock it, if needed. Then press “OK” on the warning & wait for motor initialization.
  3. At the login screen, click “OK” to login as  _Guest_. 
    1. [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/e/e2/Olympus_LEXT_-_login_guest.png/200px-Olympus_LEXT_-_login_guest.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olympus_LEXT_-_login_guest.png)
    2. System should automatically display the “Acquisition” tab


### Load & focus on sample
  1. Place your sample near the center of the stage.
  2. Make sure **5x** objective is selected and objectives will not hit stage if motors move down. If unsure, click “ _Cancel_ ” on the “ _Move to Z reference position_ ” dialogue, and lift the objectives using the manual focus knob.
  3. Click the “Scan Position” button [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/7/7b/Olympus_LEXT_-_Button_Flag_measurement_position.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olympus_LEXT_-_Button_Flag_measurement_position.png) to move the stage to center 
  4. System should already be imaging live in Color mode. If not, click the “Color” imaging button [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/00/Olympus_LEXT_-_Color_imaging_button.png/50px-Olympus_LEXT_-_Color_imaging_button.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olympus_LEXT_-_Color_imaging_button.png), and ensure the “Live” window-tab has a halo around it by clicking on it, like so: [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/29/Olympus_LEXT_-_Live_halo.png/95px-Olympus_LEXT_-_Live_halo.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olympus_LEXT_-_Live_halo.png)
  5. Focus on the sample surface by using the black manual focus knob first, unlocking/re-locking if needed. This prevents the electronic focus motor from hitting it’s limit during imaging. 
    1. Make sure to engage the focus “Lock” ring (finger-tight only), otherwise the focus will drift.
  6. Fine-Focus (electronic) by using the Mouse-Wheel (Right-click the live image to set wheel to Coarse focus), or by using the “Focus” up/down arrows on the right of the image.
  7. Use the joystick to drive to feature of interest. 
    1. **Make sure sample's TOP surface is in focus before Stepping up in objectives/magnification, to prevent crashing.**
    2. The higher the magnification, the better the height resolution.
  8. Click the Laser imaging mode button [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/a/a2/Olympus_LEXT_-_laser_imaging_button.png/50px-Olympus_LEXT_-_laser_imaging_button.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olympus_LEXT_-_laser_imaging_button.png)
  9. Readjust electronic focus until the sample surface lights up. 
    1. May need to adjust laser Brightness (vertical tab on image pane), for max brightness but not saturating can use “Saturation Highlighting” to show this `<<pic of saturation highlighting>>`


### Acquisition Settings / Scan Range
  1. Set the Acquisition Settings to [_Fine_ ▽] & [√]  _Manual, like so:_
    1. [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/fd/Olympus_LEXT_-_acquisition_settings_-_Fine%2C_manual_annot.png/200px-Olympus_LEXT_-_acquisition_settings_-_Fine%2C_manual_annot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olympus_LEXT_-_acquisition_settings_-_Fine,_manual_annot.png)
    2. [√] Color mode will scan the in color mode and then in laser mode, and superimpose the true-color image onto the 3D image.
  2. Expand the [+] on the right of the image and enable  _Saturation Highlighting_
    1. [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/52/Olympus_LEXT_-_Saturation_Highlighting_button_highlighted.png/40px-Olympus_LEXT_-_Saturation_Highlighting_button_highlighted.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Olympus_LEXT_-_Saturation_Highlighting_button_highlighted.png)
  3. Focus ⇓on the lowest surface of your sample. Go a few mouse-wheel clicks below that focus point until lowest surface has reduced in brightness and click the [Bottom] button to save this Z height as the lower point of the scan range.
  4. Focus ⇑on the highest surface, and go a few clicks above that until brightness decreases, and click the [Top] scan range button. 
    1. If you see any regions of the sample surface reach saturation anywhere in the scan range, lower the image brightness using the Brightness arrows on the right of the imaging panel. `<<pic of brightness buttons>>`. 
    2. Higher brightness reduces noise, but saturation reduces accuracy of surface height detection.
    3.

# About
This tool simultaneously measures the optical transmission and reflection spectrum through a thin-film. Subsequent software analysis allows the user to calculate absorbance, color index properties, film thickness and/or refractive index. A Halogen lamp (Vis/nIR) and Deuterium lamp (UV) are available as light sources. The system has two spectrometers, spanning the UV (190nm) to near infrared (1700nm). 
The data can optionally be modeled and the optical parameters (thickness, refractive index, absorption coefficient) are adjusted to give a best least-squared fit to the data. The accuracy of the technique will depend on the thickness of the film and the optical models used for the fitting of the data. For a more complete description go to 
For high-accuracy refractive index data, we recommend using the [J.A. Woolam Ellipsometer](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ellipsometer_\(Woollam\) ""Ellipsometer \(Woollam\)""), while The F10-RT will provide higher accuracy for thicker films and multi-layer coatings that the JAW has trouble modeling. 
# Equipment Specifications
  * 190–1700 nm reflection & transmission spectrum (simultaneous)
  * 10 Å to 150 µm film thickness, n, and k measurements
  * Manual sample placement.
  * Sample size 10 mm to 150 mm 
    * Smaller samples can be accommodated on glass slides if needed.

# About
This tool is for thickness and optical property measurements of films on substrates, including mapping of thin-films on full wafers. The technique used is white light reflection. Data is taken with normal incidence reflection of white light from the surface using a Deuterium (UV) and Halogen (Vis-nIR) lamps. 
The system can either do motorized wafer-mapping of optical properties, or take non-motorized single-spot measurements (faster). 
The motorized stage automatically acquires optical reflection spectra at programmed points across the wafer. At each point, the reflection spectrum is baselines, and the reflection data is modeled at each point, and finally the optical parameters (thickness/refractive index/absorption) are adjusted to give a best least-squared fit to the data. The accuracy of the technique will depend on the thickness of the film and the optical models used for the fitting of the data.

# About
This tool is for thickness and optical property measurements of films on silicon substrates. Other substrates are permitted, but results will not be accurate. The technique used is white light reflection. Data is taken with normal incidence reflection of white light (480 nm – 850 nm) from the surface and spectral data is captured through a spectrometer attached to the camera port of the microscope. The data is modeled and the optical parameters are adjusted to give a best least-squared fit to the data. Refractive index can be manually entered or used as a parameter in the fitting routine. Absorbing films will give incorrect results. This unit can measure thicknesses of films in spots down to approximately 10 um, allowing for measurement of thin films at various points in the processing. 
# Equipment Specifications
  * 480-850 nm reflection spectrum
  * Designed for silicon substrates; others allowed, but accuracy not guaranteed
  * 150 A to tens of microns thickness measurements
  * Do not use refractive index option for very thin films
  * Manual wafer placement, up to 6"" wafers
  * Objectives of 5x, 10x, and 20x for 40 um, 20 um, and 10 um spot sizes.; can measure film properties in small areas
  * Thicker films require lower objective magnification due to depth of focus
  * Programs for PR, SiO2, SiN on silicon

## About
The Oxford PlasmaPro 100 Cobra 300 is intended for etching InP-based, GaAs-baased and GaN-based epitaxies, in addition to Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) processes. The system has a load lock, wide temperature range with rapid heating/cooling, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) coil and a capactively coupled substrate HF (13.56MHz) The fixturing is configured for 4"" diameter Si wafers and uses a clamp to hold the sample on the RF chuck. Small pieces may be placed on Silicon carrier wafers, with or without mounting adhesive. Helium back-side cooling is used to keep the sample cool during the etch, but pieces do heat up when placed on carriers. 
The in-situ laser monitor installed on this system allows for repeatable etches and endpoint detection via continuous optical monitoring of the wafer reflectivity in a user-determined location, through a porthole on the chamber. The system also has an _in situ_ optical emission monitor for plasma spectroscopy, utilized for chamber clean endpoint detection.

## Sample Size Effect on Etch Rate (Oxford ICP Etcher)
We have found that the size of the InP piece loaded (no adhesive, onto Silicon carrier wafer) affects the etch rate, but does not affect the etch profile - ie. **etches are still smooth and vertical, but etch rate varies with sample area.**
**InP Ridge Etch** : 60°C, 3mT, 800W/65W, Cl2=18, H2=15, CH4=10sccm, time=5min05sec (305sec) Silicon carrier, no adhesive.

## [Ashers (Technics PEII)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)"")
### CF4/O2 PEii
Gas is CF4 / O2 (88%/12%) 
#### SiN Etching
  * Pressure = 300mT–350mT
  * Power = 100W
  * Etch Rate ≈ 50-100 nm/min. Varies.
  * Process notes: Make sure to PR-protect the underside, _and_ the bevel/wafer edge, as the SiN can be removed in those areas as well if not covered by PR. You can coat the wafer bevel/edge using a swab, manually ""painting"" the bevel while the wafer is on a PR spinner vacuum chuck, and then the Brewer Lift-pin hotplate (Bay 7) to bake at ~100-110degC.


#### Chamber Clean after CF4 Etching
  * Pressure = 300mT–350mT
  * Power = 100W
  * Time = 10min


### O2 Ashing
O2; 300mT / 100W - on either Technics asher. 
~15sec to make a surface hydrophilic, eg. before wet etching or applying photoreist. 
~30-120sec to improve wirebonding pad metal prior to deposition of liftoff metal. 
~1-5min to remove polymerized photoresist/scum after dry etching 
~5-10min to strip ~0.5-1.0µm photoresist. Rotate wafer 180° halfway through etch. Optionally increase to 200W for faster etching. 
Use glass slides to prevent wafers from sliding on platen. 
## [Plasma Clean (Gasonics 2000)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Plasma_Clean_\(Gasonics_2000\) ""Plasma Clean \(Gasonics 2000\)"")
Recipes are posted at the tool, with photoresist etch rates. 
## [Plasma Clean (YES EcoClean)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Plasma_Clean_\(YES_EcoClean\) ""Plasma Clean \(YES EcoClean\)"")
Some negative photoresists (eg. UVN) do not strip well without ion bombardment (requiring Technics PEii or RIE/ICP instead). We believe that the UV exposure from plasma may increase hardening via crosslinking. 
Recipe Temperature control is by the lift-pins , with hotplate at 200°C 
### N2/O2 Recipes
#### Recipe Names:
  * ""**STD-N2-O2-_180C_ -_3kW_ -_3min_** "" 
    * These recipes used to be named “180C-3kW-3min”, prior to 2023-09-15.
    * The new, Renamed recipes are identical, except have a 1x pump/purge added to the start of the cycle to improve repeatability.
  * Variations: (underlined portion of filename above) 
    * Temperature: 100C, 130C, 150C,180C 
      * NOTE: some wafers will get hotter than the indicated temperature, due to optical absorption. See below for alternative recipes that avoid this.
    * Power: 3kW, 0.7kW 
      * 3kW is very fast for full PR strip, but often increases substrate temperature significantly.
      * 0.7kW reduces substrate temperature, although exact values are not known.
    * Time: Various times are available, with strings such as ""30sec"", ""1min"", ""3min"" etc.
  * [Recipe screenshots](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/YES_Recipe_Screenshots:_STD-N2-O2 ""YES Recipe Screenshots: STD-N2-O2"")


#### Recipe Characterization:
  * [Various Resists Etched at 150C-3kW](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/YES-150C-Various-Resists ""YES-150C-Various-Resists"")
  * [SPR220-7 at 3kW various Temps with N2/O2 recipes](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/YES-SPR220-Various-Temps ""YES-SPR220-Various-Temps"")


3kW recipes appear to gradually heat wafers beyond the hotplate temperature, and also expose the underside of the wafer. Very efficient cleaning of positive photoresists, but exact temperature is unknown and may increase with time. 
#### N2/O2 effect on Gold contacts & Substrate Temperature
These Nitrogen-containing recipes, at both 3kW and 0.7kW, have a tendency to oxidize Gold, turning Gold contacts brown. We found that the optical emission of the N2 plasma emits strongly in the visible, which is absorbed especially by Gold (especially Blue/UV optical absorption, that's why Gold looks yellow), causing additional heating of the surface, perhaps as much as 100°C hotter. If your devices contain gold contacts, or are very temperature sensitive, consider using our O2-only recipes below. 
### O2-Only Recipes
O2-only recipes do not oxidize gold contacts, and have been found to have stable/repeatable temperatures, and lower PR etch rates than N2-O2 recipes. See below for PR etch rates. 
NOTE: The O2 plasma does not emit much light, because the plasma is remote. The tool is etching even if the porthole does not look brightly lit. 
  * Recipe Names: ""**STD-O2-_100C_ -_3kW_ -_3min_** ""
  * Variations: (underlined portion of filename above) 
    * _Temperature_ : 100C, 130C, 150C, 180C
    * _Power_ : 3kW
    * _Time_ : Various times are available, with strings such as ""30sec"", ""1min"", ""3min"" up to ""15min""

## [UV Ozone Reactor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/UV_Ozone_Reactor ""UV Ozone Reactor"")
The UV Ozone Reactor is used for two purposes: 
  * Etch away organic residue with no ion bombardment
  * Oxidize surface (monolayers) of a substrate, which has been used for 
    * Providing a wet-etchable sacrifical surface layer which is removed prior to deposition or regrowth
    * Controlled digital etching, by wet etching the oxide and then repeating the oxidation/etch cycle.

## About
This is a Plasma-Therm model 790 plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system for depositing SiO2, Si3N4, or SiOxNy dielectric films. The system uses a capacitively-coupled 13.56 MHz source excitation to produce the plasma between two parallel aluminum plates. The gas is injected over the sample through a 6” diameter showerhead. The samples are placed on the system anode (to minimize ion damage) which is heated to 250-350°C. SiO2 is produced from SiH4/He 2%/98% and N2O at 250°C. The typical deposition rate is 400 A/min. at 300 mT pressure. The typical BOE etch rate of this oxide is about 400 nm/min. Si3N4 is produced from SiH4/He 2%/98% and NH3 at 250°C or 350°C. The more dense films are produced at 350°C. The stress of the nitride can be altered by adjusting the N2:He ratio of the deposition. CF4/O2 plasmas are used to clean the chamber between depositions. 
These films are typically used for capacitor dielectrics, chemical passivation layers, electrical insulators, reactive ion etching masks, and optical anti-reflective coatings. The system is fully programmable with windows-based software and has a wide array of pre-defined thicknesses. Custom programs for dielectric stacks or different process parameters can be written and saved.

## Standard Cleaning Procedure (PECVD #1)
The cleaning procedure is very important in order to have consistent result on this tool and also to keep particulate count low. After each deposition you should clean the tool following instructions carefully. The clean is done in two steps: 
  1. Wet cleaning (start cleaning by using a cleanroom wipe sprayed with DI. Wipe chamber sidewalls with it. Finish cleaning by using the cleanroom wipe sprayed with IPA. )
  2. Load the recipe for cleaning ""CF4/O2 Clean"" (edit the recipe and change ONLY time of cleaning). Follow instructions regarding a required time for cleaning.

The system currently has **Deuterated Silane (SiD4)** installed - identical to the regular Silicon precursor SiH4, except that it significantly lowers optical absorption in the near-infrared due to shifted molecular vibrations/molecular weights. This gas is more expensive and thus more applicable to optical application than to general-purpose SiN films.

## Standard Cleaning Procedure [ICP-PECVD]
You must edit the Post-Dep Clean recipe to correspond to your deposited thickness and material. See the [Operating Procedure on the Unaxis Tool Page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ICP-PECVD_\(Unaxis_VLR\)#Documentation ""ICP-PECVD \(Unaxis VLR\)"") for details. 
  * SiNx etches at 20nm/min
  * SiO2 etches at 40nm/min


### Standard Clean Recipe
## General Recipe Notes (Unaxis VLR ICP-PECVD)
  * RF1 = Bias
  * RF2 = ICP Power
  * All recipes start with an Argon pre-clean with 0W bias (gentle), to improve adhesion/nucleation.
  * Maximum SiO2 Dep. thickness allowed: 800nm 
    * Above this thickness, you must run a chamber clean/season before depositing more onto your product wafer.

### Dicing Alignment Instructions
The Process Group often has users fill out these instructions below to fully define a dicing job. This will ensure you have thought about the entire dicing process. 
Note that you should design your chips with ≥250µm dicing street width, to avoid the blade cutting into your devices. 
It is very helpful to also place alignment guides in the dicing streets, such as crosses at the intersections of dicing streets, such as this: 
`---- + ---- + ---- + ---`
`     |      |      |`
`---- + ---- + ---- + ---`
`     |      |      |`
`---- + ---- + ---- + ---`

### Recommended Dicing Parameters
This table is for our stocked 
-2C blades are 2mils/50µm wide, -4C blades are 4mils/100µm wide, and -8C blades are 8mils/200µm wide. Plan for ~10–30µm extra edge clearance to account for kerf, chipping, etc. 
Narrower (~30-50µm) Nickel Hubbed blades are often used for even narrower dicing streets, these must be purchased by the user. KnS G1440-Q5H0 work very well, with ~30µm blade width and smaller kerf. You need to insert a shim to use these blades - please contact [tool supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Dicing_Saw_\(ADT\) ""Dicing Saw \(ADT\)"") for how to use these blades.

#### Anatomy of a Blade
Example: **2.187-4C-9RU-3**
""2.187"": This is the blade Outer Diameter (""OD"") in inches (55.55 mm). 
""4C"": Blade thickness in mils. 4 mil = 100 µm 
""9"": Diamond particle size in microns. Stocked resin blades have embedded diamond particles. Smaller particles create a smoother kerf, but remove less material and are thus less robust or require slower cutting speeds. 
""RU-3"". A blade parameter that deals with cut quality vs. robustness (lifetime) of the blade. 
### Calculated Blade Exposures

  * Full Release: 120 sec exposure
  * Partial Release for Shipping: 9 sec exposure


#### Wax-Mounting to Carrier
If your final die size will be very small, eg. <3mm square or so, the chances increase that many die will be ejected into the cooling water stream once you begin the 2nd cut angle, because the total surface area of die contacting the adhesive tape becomes very low 
A method to overcome this is to mount your sample with CrystalBond wax onto a Silicon carrier wafer. The wax is a much stronger adhesive. The drawback is that you must dissolve the wax to unmount your die, often resulting in a jumbled pile of small die in Acetone/Isopropanol, which can be difficult to handle/sort afterwards. 
  

Procedure to mount with wax onto a carrier wafer:   
---  
  * Prepare a clean silicon carrier wafers, at least ~5mm larger than your sample to be diced.
  * The Bay 5 solvent bench is most commonly used for wax mounting, although any solvent bench can be used as long as you cover the hotplate with wax and are careful to clean up any mess.
  * Cover the hotplate (cool) with clean tinfoil, and then raise temp to 130-150°C.
  * Place the silicon carrier on top, polished wide up, and wait a few min for it to heat up. Pressing down with tweezers can help speed this up.
  * Take either a small measured/weighed piece of crystalbond wax, or the whole stick, and touch/press it against the silicon carrier. The wax sticks are stored often on the bench shelves, edge of the bench, or the outside wall of the bench (where the vacuum ports are for the Bay 4 solvent bench).
  * Once a large enough puddle of melted wax is produced, remove the wax stick (use tweezers to hold the carrier wafer down), being careful to prevent the wax stringers from landing all over the workspace. You can clean it up later when the hotplate is cold. 
    * You want to make sure the entire underside of the sample will be contacting the wax, but don’t want so much wax that the sample will be tilted/uneven. Excess wax can easily be removed on an upcoming step.
  * With tweezers, place your sample to be diced on the wax, face up.
  * Optional: press down the edges/corners of the sample to make it approximately flat.
  * Remove the entire tinfoil sheet, with carrier wafer, from the hotplate to let it cool down. Once cool (few mins), remove your silicon carrier with sample attached.
  * Optional: To remove wax from the top surface of your sample, or from the edges, one effective way is to place the mounted assembly onto a POLOS spinner and, while spinning at ~1500-2000rpm, spray with ACE spray bottle for ~30sec, the ISO & N2 dry. This removes wax on the top without significantly attacking the wax mounting between the samples. You could also attempt to use a cotton swab with ACE, although this is typically much less clean.
  * Proceed to apply your surface protection for dicing, eg. Photoresist coating or blue tape etc.

### Dicing Tips
Harder materials will often require larger diamond particle sizes, and thicker blades will last longer if they are overheating and breaking often. 
It is not uncommon to have to change a blade in the middle of cutting a wafer - the software is set up to allow this easily without aborting the programmed cuts. The ""Height Check Rate"" in the recipe will check the blade exposure after this many cuts, using the optical height sensor - this allows you to see how quickly the blade is wearing out (as blade exposure reduces). 
Ensuring the cut water jet is hitting at ~7-8 o'clock on the blade and the water jet is being split in two will keep the blade coolest and help prevent breakage. Water sprays should be set to 0.9/0.9/0.9 by default. 
For sapphire dicing (very hard material), it is common to use ""double-pass dicing"", where the substrate is cut at only half depth (eg. cutting only 150µm deep for a 300µm thick substrate) on the first pass, and then re-cut at the full depth. The blade will need to be changed often, so set your ""Height Check Rate"" to 1 or 2. This can be very time consuming. 200-300µm thick Sapphire substrates are much easier to cut than 650µm thick - often single-pass dicing is adequate for the thinner substrates. 
### Surface Protection
#### Photoresist
Users most often use sacrificial photoresists to protect the surface from accumulating dicing dust. The static-buildup of dielectric films causes the dust to adhere strongly. Ensure that the PR thickness will adequately coat all your exposed topography (eg. use a ≥2µm thick PR for protecting 1.5-2.0µm tall etched features). 
  1. Choose a photoresist of appropriate thickness, and spin-coat it & soft-bake it according to a standard recipe. 
    1. [Contact Alignment PR Recipes](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Alignment_Recipes ""Contact Alignment Recipes"")
    2. [Stepper PR Recipes](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes ""Stepper Recipes"")


  1. Perform your dicing
  2. Remove the die from the UV release tape (60sec UV Exposure)
  3. Strip the PR from each die in Acetone and ISO & N2 dry. We recommend to use ACE/ISO squirt bottles on each die individually to ensure the particles on the PR surface don’t land and stick to the chip surface.


#### Blue Tape
Alternatively our low-tack residue-free Blue tape can be used to protect the die surface. 
Blue tape removal is easy for large die, but does require manual removal from each die, and eliminates sample exposure to solvents. 
You will need to physically, gently press the blue tape onto the wafer surface, while eliminating bubbles. Do this by placing your wafer directly in front of the blue tape-roll dispenser, then attaching the tape to the table over the wafer (without touching wafer), allowing you to press the tape onto the wafer progressively from one side. 
The very edges of the die may accumulate a bit more dicing dust due to the tape delaminating slightly during dicing. Plan for about 50-100µm of edge clearance on each die. 
### Cut Depth Accuracy
Depth accuracy (distance between bottom of the blade and sample chuck) (a) is only accurate to ~20µm or so, and (b) varies by at least~10µm across the chuck. If you need to leave a certain amount of your substrate uncut, here is a way to improve the accuracy, adds ~30-60min to your process. 
#### Procedure to improve cut depth accuracy
To achieve an accurate depth like <30µm accuracy: 
  * Do Manual alignment of sample.
  * You will do test cuts on the tape only (with sample mounted, but ~50mm away from sample in Y-direction (not X!)) - nominally 90µm thick but I think the plastic thickness varies between ~60-100µm as a guess. Then progressively reduce the depth to se when it hits the tape. 
  * Do Manual y-offset, with depth (distance between tip of blade & chuck)=0.070mm
  * If you don’t see a cut, then [Cancel]
  * Adjust recipe to -0.010mm depth, 0.060mm in this case
  * Do Manual Y-offset again 10mm away from original cut
  * Repeat until you see the blade just scraping the surface. You will see it “skips”, hitting then missing then hitting (this is the tape or chuck height variation) 
    * That is the depth to hit the tape.
  * (To ascertain the variation, keep going down by 10µm increments until you see a “full” cut with no skips.)
  * Then in your recipe, add the desired remaining amount 
    * eg. Depth to hit tape = 0.060mm + 0.070mm remaining uncut sample = 0.130mm cut depth. 
    * (30µm will also work, you’ll just see it varies by ~20µm across the cut.)

## About
  1. The InfraScope ""HotSpot"" software is a failure analysis/fault isolation tool for semiconductor failure analysis. The InfraScope detects thermal infrared photons emitted from hot areas on semiconductor circuits. Such hot spot sites often mark the location of a process fault or damaged location of a circuit, such as a short circuit.
  2. The ""Emmi"" software detects photons emitted from electron-hole recombination sites on semiconductor circuits. Such recombination sites often mark the location of a process fault or damaged location of a circuit. The NIR cameral operates at 400nm - 1,000nm wavelength.
  3. The ""Thermal Map"" software allows the user to perform temperature mapping of materials and devices. The user easily determines the exact temperature at any point by color or by simply positioning the mouse arrow over the desired point and reading the desired temperature. This technique saves literally hundreds of hours over non-infrared techniques and it doesn't damage or affect the part in any way.


## Capabilities
  * 6 inch heated chuck, default temp = 40°C
  * Micrometer probes
  * Dark box
  * Two Keithley DC power supplies (SMU's). 0-200VDC & 0-1100VDC. 
    * Users may bring their own power supplies as needed for their specific devices and material testing.
  * ≤ 2.7µm resolution in the MWIR.
  * Cameras & Microscope objectives: 
    * Visible: 1x Macro
    * Visible + Near Infrared: 2.5x, 5x, 20x, 50x
    * Mid-IR (MWIR): 2x, 5x, 15x
  * The MWIR camera (LN2 cooled InSb) nominally operates at 1um - 5um wavelength with filtering nominally from 2-4µm, although intentional light emission beyond the filtered range is commonly observed. 
    * Users working on Mid-Infrared photonics can use this to take microscope observations of sub-threshold MIR optical emission. **Do _not_ shine high power laser emission towards the camera!**

Photolithography - Improving Adhesion Photoresist Adhesion,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Photolithography_-_Improving_Adhesion_Photoresist_Adhesion,"Don't forget that, for [lift-off processes](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lithography_Recipes#Lift-Off_Recipes ""Lithography Recipes""), the Imaging (top) Photoresist will lift-off as well if you undercut it too much during develop! 
## Underlayers for improving PR adhesion
High-temperature (>150°C) underlayers, such as LOL1000/2000, BARC layers tend to improve adhesion of the imaging resist. 
  * Substrate prep: O2 plasma ([PEii Technics](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)"")), 10sec
  * Apply high-temp underlayer, eg. LOL1000/2000, PMGI, DSK101 (DUV), DSK42P (DUV) 
    * Beware of underlayers that have a develop-rate - undercutting the imaging PR fully can also cause delamination)
  * Apply your Imaging photoresist as normal.


## HMDS Process for PR Improving Adhesion
This process tends to improve adhesion between the substrate and subsequent photoresist layers. Use this procedure if you are finding poor adhesion (resist delaminating during develop etc.), or for chemicals (like BHF) that attack the PR adhesion interface strongly. 
  * 150°C bake ~2min (Dehydration step) 
    * Optionally could instead do Dehydration of: O2 plasma ([PEii Technics](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)"")), 10sec; however this could create more surface SiO2 on silicon.
  * HMDS application & soak 40s 
    * Do this with sample loaded on the PR spinner.
  * Spin-dry - any spin speed, ~15-30sec
  * HMDS bake at 100-110°C for 90s. 
  * Then your normal PR process on top.

## Purpose of Edge Bead Removal
Removing the thicker photoresist along the edges of your sample (aka. edge-bead removal, EBR) has multiple advantages: 
  * These techniques are required for loading full-wafers into etchers that use top-side clamps, to prevent photoresist from sticking to the clamp (and potentially destroying your wafer).
  * For contact lithography, this improves the proximity of the mask plate and sample, improving resolution.
  * For some projection systems, such as the Maskless Aligner, EBR can help with autofocus issues.


## Razor Blade
Use a razor blade to scrape off the edge-bead regions. This works well for small samples, if the substrate material is not fragile (works well for Silicon, Sapphire, GaAs, Silica etc.). 
Especially useful for photoresists that don't chemically dissolve easily, such as PMGI, SU8, BCB. 
## EBR100 Swabbing
AZ EBR100 squirt bottles can be found on the spinner benches. (Do NOT bring Acetone onto the spin-benches! The fumes affect nearby PR.) Only use this chemical in a fume hood, and dispose in the waste in the fume hood waste containers. 
EBR100 dries quickly without wicking onto the wafer/PR, so is preferred for edge-bead removal. 
  1. Squirt some EBR onto a COTTON swab (not plastic swab! They will dissolve.)
  2. Roll the swab on a cleanwipe to remove excess liquid.
  3. Use the swab like a paintbrush to remove PR from the edge of the wafer, re-soaking as needed.
  4. Better to remove TOO MUCH edge-bead than too little - high chance of wafer sticking to machine clamp if you remove too little.


## Lithographic Edge Bead Removal
This method significantly lowers the risk of breaking a wafer in clamped systems such as the DSEiii or Fluorine Etcher. 
This process only removes the outermost photoresist for Positive PR's. For Negative PR's, your should design you litho so there is no exposure on the outer 7mm, so the PR is automatically removed during develop. 
For small parts (1-2 cm) square or irregularly shaped, you can cut pieces of tinfoil into small squares, and mask all but 2 edges and flood expose those two edges (on a contact aligner), then repeat for the other two edges. Expose with 3-5x the typical dose, since the PR is thick at the edge. Then develop the sample to remove the edge bead. Subsequent litho will work fine. 
For larger parts (eg. full wafers), you will want to make a custom plastic or metal mask that you can place on top of the wafer during flood expose - then develop to remove the edge-bead. 
We do have simple metal masks made for 4-inch wafers, that you can use on the [Suss MA6](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Aligner_\(SUSS_MA-6\) ""Contact Aligner \(SUSS MA-6\)"") for I-Line Flood Expose mode or on the [DUV Flood Expose](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/DUV_Flood_Expose ""DUV Flood Expose"") to expose your edge bead. The metal mask is stored in Bay7, in the bottom-most blue Vidmar drawers between the Suss MA6 & GCA Stepper #1, in a transparent cassette labeled “**edge bead removal mask** ”. We require the ""4mm recessed"" mask for clamp systems.

### I-Line Photo-EBR Process
  * Spin/cure an I-Line photoresist using your standard photolith. params (for example [SPR 220-3](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_\(GCA_6300\) ""Stepper Recipes"")).
  * Don't load a mask plate.
  * Turn off ""Load Mask"" mode - you will likely need to confirm that no mask is present.
  * Place the wafer on the [MA-6 Contact Aligner](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Contact_Aligner_\(SUSS_MA-6\) ""Contact Aligner \(SUSS MA-6\)"") with the metal mask in place. 
  * You will use [Lamp Test] for the exposure. You can also use ""Flood Expose"" program and type in an exposure time.
  * Expose for about 3-2x longer than your normal exposure time.
  * Load wafer into your I-Line exposure tool & Expose your process
  * Run your PEB and Develop as per your normal process. 
    * (If you did not develop the EBR yet, it should go away in this step.)


### DUV Photo-EBR Process
  * Spin/cure a DUV photoresist using your standard photolith. params (for example [UV6](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes#Positive_Resist_.28ASML_DUV.29 ""Stepper Recipes"")).
  * Place the wafer on the [**DUV Flood Exposer**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/DUV_Flood_Expose ""DUV Flood Expose"") with the metal mask in place. 
  * Turn on rotation on slow (so mask doesn't move), lamp warmup is not required.
  * Expose for 13 sec, with slow rotation.
  * _Optionally:_ PEB 135°C, 60sec, Develop, dry (in SRD), then proceed. This did not affect my primary lithography when I did this step separately. I've also done photo-EBR where I combined this EBR exposure with the primary Imaging litho. and only did a single develop.
  * Load wafer into ASML & Expose your process
  * PEB 135°C, 90sec
  * 300MiF develop as per your normal process. 
    * (If you did not develop the EBR yet, it should go away in this step.)

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

#  About
The Aura 2000 system is a microwave downstream asher used for the removal of resist and other organic materials. Samples are loaded onto 8” carrier wafers into the system. Samples can be heated from 100C to above 350C by heat lamps, while being exposed to microwave-cracked oxygen to remove organic materials. The microwave excitation of the oxygen is done downstream from the chamber and the reactive oxygen flows through a showerhead to expose the sample, thus completely eliminating ion bombardment. Resist etch rates of several microns per minute can be achieved and is also effective on fluorine and chlorine plasma exposed resist.

## About
The YES EcoClean system is an ICP downstream asher used for the removal of resist and other organics. 
4"" wafers are cassette loaded or smaller samples are loaded onto 4"" carriers into the system. 
Samples can be heated from ~120°C to 200°C by controlling the sample height via the lift pins during process, while being exposed to ICP-cracked oxygen to remove organic materials. 
### Etch Method
The excitation of the oxygen is done remotely and a baffle keeps charged ions from reaching the surface, leaving primarily neutral Oxygen radicals in the gas mixture. Radicals diffuse and are scattered across the wafer surface for efficient cleaning and PR removal without any ion damage. This behaves like a wet-etch with reactive Oxygen. No ion bombardment at all, so isotropic (omni-directional) etch - attacks sidewalls just as fast as top surfaces. Heat is used to increase reaction rate. Treat this as a purely chemical process, accelerated by heat (Arrhenius plot - rate goes up exponentially with temperature). 
Note that our recipes use a lift-pin to adjust temperature quickly, with hotplate always set to 200°C (constant). This means that the _back_ of the wafer is exposed to the reactive gas for temperatures <200°C (when wafer is lifted). 
### Applications
Resist etch rates of multiple microns per minute can be achieved. 
Use this where you know a purely chemical etch will suffice, for example PR etching. PR stripping is fast and cassette loaded. Works best for PR that hasn't been significantly changed (eg. Chlorinated, or Polymerized - in these cases some small residue can be left.) - follow up with [PEii Technics](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)"") etch to remove more stubborn residues. 
See the process pages below for etch recipes for various resist removal recipes.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

## About
The probe station in the cleanroom is set up for up to four-point probing of two terminal and three terminal devices. The probe station is a Signatone station with a 2” diameter vacuum chuck. Four probes are provided. The measurements can be taken with various electronic test equipment detailed below, including HP multimeters, a Tektronix Curve-Tracer and a Keithley Source-Meter unit (SMU). 
The Curve Tracer & Keithley SMU can be controlled by a computer to get portable data. FETs, HBTs, diodes, and contact resistance measurements are typically done on this system. The 370A curve tracer is capable of pulsed and DC operation. 
The system is commonly used for characterizing contacts metals and anneals and contact resistances, diode I-V curves, in addition to other electrical measurements to determine optimal fabrication conditions.

## [RechargeApp](https://nanofabserver2.ece.ucsb.edu/NanofabRecharge/admin/login/)
Click above for our internal billing system. Requires you to be on the internal Nanofiles network, or on VPN. 
## Supplies Costs
Here are some costs of typical supplies, used by Remote 'Fab Service users. Charge for All wafers, including test/dummy wafers that we don't send to the user. Discuss any possible exceptions as needed. 
Item  | Cost  | Notes   
---|---|---  
_**Wafers**_ _(use these for billing)_  
Silicon Prime -Grade 100mm  | $16.95 per wafer  | random doping, <100>. (average price)   
Silicon ""Ultraflat"" 100mm  | $55 per wafer  | for high-res. ASML, random doping, <100>  
_**Containers etc.**_  
1.5"" wafer trays  | $ 2.00  |   
1.5"" spring/spiders  | $ 0.75  |   
2"" wafer trays  | $ 3.00  |   
2"" spring/spiders  | $ 0.75  |   
3"" wafer tray  | $ 4.26  |   
3"" spring/Spring  | $ 1.02  |   
4"" wafer tray  | $ 4.51  | Tray + Spring = $5.59 Stored in Chase 6, large blue tote on floor.   
4"" spring/spring  | $ 1.08   
_**Dicing Supplies**_  
Ultron 8"" Shipper  | $ 12.75  | Stored in Demis' Office   
Ultron 8"" Frame  | $ 14.25  | Standard metal ring used for dicing   
Ultron 6"" Shipper  | $ 11.25  | Stored in Demis' Office   
Ultron 6"" Frame  | $ 9.25  | Old metal rings, have many left over.   
_**Grip Rings: (not currently used)**_  
Ultron 8"" Grip-Ring  | $ 11.00  |   
Ultron 6"" Grip-Ring  | $ 10.50  |   
## FedEx Charges
To be added 
- use ""NanoFab passthrough"" account 
- view Ship History and View Details to get the ""courtesy rate quote"" (should be ~$20). 
- Charge that amount to the user. See below for Overhead on these rates. 
## Overhead charges
All Non-UC users must be charged an additional percentage (currently 55.5%) on extra supplies (wafers, trays, FedEx shipping etc.). This is because UC researchers are required to give 55.5% of all their incoming grant funding directly to UC for overhead, so external users should also have to pay this to make it equal. 
This charge is called the ""**Facilities and Administrative** "", or ""**F &A**"" rate. 
RechargeApp now has this feature built-in to make it easier. 
  1. As normal, choose ""Add Line Item for Other Charges"" (eg. wafers, wafer trays, supplies or shipping costs) [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/83/RechargeApp_-_01_-_line_items_for_other_charges.png/150px-RechargeApp_-_01_-_line_items_for_other_charges.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:RechargeApp_-_01_-_line_items_for_other_charges.png)
  2. You'll see the field for ""**F &A Rate**"", which defaults to the 55.5% (editable by BrianT). 
    1. When this value is set, the Invoices will add a 2nd line-item, which is a copy of what you typed in, but only the 55.5% charge as a separate item.
  3. If you are billing a U.C. user (UC Santa Cruz, Irvine, Riverside etc. etc.), **set the F &A rate to Zero: 0**. 
    1. They will Not have the F&A line-item added to their invoice as long as the rate = 0. [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/51/RechargeApp_-_02_-_F%2BA_auto_v2.png/500px-RechargeApp_-_02_-_F%2BA_auto_v2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:RechargeApp_-_02_-_F%2BA_auto_v2.png)
  4. Save the Line Item.


The new item is only added when Invoices are generated, typically at the end of the billing month. So you can safely edit these as much as needed before Invoices are generated. 
If a ""Line Item for Other Charges"" must be edited after Invoices have been generated, be sure to check for incorrect or additional Line Items created for F&A charges. 
## Billing Rates: Which Should I Use?
You see all our rates at the NanoFab Website > [**_Services_**](https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/services). 
**Staff** or **CR** is ""Staff time"" versus ""Cleanroom Hours"", as before. 
Pay attention, there are three different academic rates now! 
  * UC (Univ. of California - eg. UCLA, UCIrvine, UCSB etc.) are ""**UC Academic** "" or ""**UCAcad** ""
  * Non-UC is ""**External Academic** "" or ""**ExAcad** "" - eg. military/government, other universities etc.
  * Companies/Industrial is ""**Indus** ""


""**Saw** "" is for dicing saw rates (to be eventually lowered below std. CR rate) 
**IBL** is Ion-Beam Litho, ie. the Raith Velion 
**EBL** is Electron-Beam Litho, ie. the JEOL EBL

### Internship Goals
Our goals are twofold: 
  1. **Increased Tool Uptime** : Acquire [Process Control Data](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Process_Group_-_Process_Control_Data ""Process Group - Process Control Data"") so NanoFab staff can proactively identify equipment/process problems, and
  2. **Industry-Relevant Experience** : Give [Interns](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Process_Group_Interns ""Process Group Interns"") hands-on industry-relevant experience to minimize the training required at any microelectronics company/research group.


  
The skills acquired for each goal are as follows: 
#### Industry-relevant Experience
  * **Protocols** : Interns become comfortable in a busy semiconductor 'fab environment. After 2-3 months of regular usage the interns are fully comfortable with: 
    * Cleanroom safety & protocols such as PPE, safe waste disposal etc.
    * Managing their own schedule to accomplish weekly processing tasks.
    * Multi-tasking to run simultaneous processes fast and efficiently. 
      * Interns learn new tools only once their current cals have been condensed into a few hours.
    * Communications with 
      * lab users (scheduling around other users)
      * equipment staff (reporting tool issues)
      * process supervisors/managers (reviewing process control data)
  * **Equipment** : Become comfortable with learning different SOP's of similar tool types 
    * Eg. 4 different plasma depositions, 4 different ICP etchers etc.
    * Once an intern has learned 3 different PECVD deposition tools, it is trivial to learn a new PECVD tool even from an unfamiliar manufacturer.
  *     * Travelers/Process Followers & associated data directories are created and filled out at run-time for every calibration. (Digital/online via Google Sheets+Drive)
    * Combining _Equipment Operating Procedures_ with _Process Travelers_ instructions at run-time.
    * Data collection with standardized digital filenames & directory structures, available online to all lab users.
  *     * Data from the Travelers are entered into online spreadsheets, which calculate SPC charts
    * Some interns create/modify SPC charts when needed for newly developed Cals.
  * **OCAP/Repair** : Work with tool engineers to identify & diagnose equipment problems. 
    * If Process Engineers identify an Out-of-Control process, Interns are involved in the communications & testing of tool repairs.


#### Process Control for Increased Uptime
  * Interns run process-control on the lab's most critical/high-usage tools.
  * Calibration processes are identical each time (unlike lab user's processes), allowing apples-to-apples comparisons.
  * Regular meetings with Process Engineers allow us to proactively identify equipment/process issues, failing tool components, and schedule repairs/remedies sooner than if detected by a lab user.
  * Lab users are notified of process anomalies & repair plans, reducing bad outcomes for lab users.
  * ""Contamination"" checks via On-Demand process-checks 
    * Determine whether a new process affects other processes on the same tool, by running pre/post Cal Etches.
    * On ICP Etchers, enables data-driven equipment sharing between processes.
    * Enables lab-users to quickly determine whether problems lie with the Equipment/""contamination"", another user's process or their own Process.


## Job Description: 2 phases
Internships are generally run in 2 phases, with each phase being approx. 1 Quarter (3 months) long. 
### Phase 1: Deposition Cals (1st Quarter)
  * Interns learn 4 different deposition tools, in the following order: 
    * Plasmatherm PECVD 1
    * Advanced Vacuum PECVD 2,
    * Unaxis ICP-PECVD,
    * Veeco Ion Beam Deposition
    * 3-4 different films (SiO2, Si3N4, Low-stress-Si3N4) are run on _each tool_.
  * Every film undergoes the following metrology: 
    * Ellipsometry: Thin-film thickness and refractive index at 2 different wavelengths.
    * Reflectometry Wafer Mapping: Thin-film Uniformity across the wafer.
    * Particle Count: laser-scanning via Surfscan, at two different particle-size/range settings
    * Thin-Film Stress: requires before & after wafer bow measurements via laser scanning
  * By the end of 1st Quarter, Interns are running 9-12 thin-film cals every 2 weeks.


### Phase 2: EtchCals and LithoCals (2nd Quarter)
  * Interns learn 4 different ICP Etchers: 
    * Plasmatherm SLR Fluorine Etcher
    * Oxford Cobra III-V Etcher

### Calibration - How do I determine the correct exposure Dose/Focus?
On tools that have motorized autofocus (steppers & direct-write litho tools), you often need to analyze both the Focus Offset & Exposure Dose simultaneously. (Remember that ""Focus Offset"" is an offset from the autofocus' ""zero"" position of the wafer surface.) These tools will have a function for shooting a ""Focus Exposure Matrix/Array"", or ""FEM/FEA"", which exposes a grid with Dose varying in one direction, and Focus varying in another - the following explains how to find the

Programming a Job,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Programming_a_Job,"## **JOB Programming - FULL**
This section describes how to set up a job to do a step and repeat exposure of your patterns. A more detailed description is given in the Reticle Handbook(White binder\Biljana's desk). Jobs are created using the command **SPEC**. First information about the array steps, alignment offsets, and general job is asked for. Passes are attached to each job to apply parameters unique to each pass specified. You can have up to 6 passes in one job. In this way all exposure information for a complete mask set can be specified all in one job. Following is the procedure for setting up a job and passes. 
**Note:** If at any point you wish to stop and start over with the job description hit CTRL C followed by A and ENTER on the keyboard to abort the SPEC command. An abort of this type will result in no saved information. Also when an asterisk * is displayed, this indicates the default value. If you hit enter for a reply to a question asked by the computer in setting up or editing any job if will be used whatever default value was. If a numeric value is asked for hitting enter will leave the value previously specified, if that exists. Also, if you put in an incorrect value and wish to go back a step press ""Shift +?” and ENTER. If you want to go back more then one step, keep pressing ""Shift+?"" and Enter until you go back at the step you want to correct. 
  1. Type **SPEC** at the colon sign, hit enter.
  2. Enter the ""**JOBNAME** "" This could be 1-9 alphanumeric characters long name.
  3. **METRIC or ENGLISH UNITS?** (*M, E). Hit enter (*M is default value).
  4. **JOB COMMENT** : Input a job comment (for example: “TEST123 process”).
  5. **TOLERANCE** (1,2,*3,4,5,6). Set tolerance to 1. Default value is 3.Please use 1-the time required to stop and settle the stage to tolerable degree of vibration.
  6. **SCALE CORRECTIONS** : Hit Enter for scale corrections. (It will be only needed if wafer shrinkage or expansion has occurred in a previous process step)
  7. **ORTHOGONALITY:** Hit enter for orthogonality, with no value.
  8. **WAFER DIAMETER** : Enter the wafer diameter in mm. This defines the maximum area in which exposure can occur. If you have a square or non-circular piece, you will need to specify a diameter that includes the entire square, not the length of a square.
  9. **< <ARRAY PARAMETERS>>**
  10. **STEP SIZE:**
  11. **_X step_** : Enter the _step size_ in X in mm at the wafer plane (5X reduction at the wafer level). Step size is [die size+gap between dies].
  12. ***C-OUNT, S-PAN or A-LL** : Use **“C”** for specifying the number of columns to expose, ""S"" for spanning certain width in X-direction, and ""A"" to fill in all area in X direction to the edge of a circular wafer. For square pieces you will always use **“C”**. For quarter wafers, you will most likely use **“C”** and make the job array look square. You will then use dropouts in each pass to specify more complicated array shapes.
  13. When “C” is entered, you need to enter the number of columns desired (for X), and number of rows (for Y).
  14. Repeat 11 through 13 for the _**Y step**_.
  15. **TRANSLATE ORIGIN** : Keep this (x=0,y=0). It is generally used only if the wafer is off-center. This is useful information for piece substrates. When aligning first time, record the coordinate of corner that you are aligning to. You can enter this info(x,y) as your translate origin in your job. If you are consistent and always load your piece at the same location on the chuck, this will help you to spend less time in aligning.
  16. **DISPLAY? (Y/N*)** : If you select ""Y"" you will see see an “*” cartoon of the exposure array. The final array will be centered on the wafer.
  17. **LAYOUT? (Y/N*)** : Layout will give you a display of the number of rows and columns and the distance from die (1,1) to the array center, taking origin translation into account. Usually this is not looked at. Hit enter to pass this up.
  18. **ADJUST? (Y/N*)** : If you wish to adjust the numbers of rows and columns you can do this at the Adjust prompt. Usually, you can hit enter to skip this.
  19. **< <ALIGNMENT PARAMETERS>>**
  20. **STANDARD KEYS? (Y/*N)** : If you choose **""Y""** , then the die used for right and left alignment is chosen automatically by the system. This is good if you have a wafer larger than 38.1mm in the X direction and both alignment marks are exactly 38.1mm apart. If you do not meet these conditions (most jobs do not), you will need to choose **""N""**.
  21. If **“N”** is chosen you will need to enter the row and column of _the right alignment die_.
  22. **_RIGHT ALIGNMENT DIE CENTER:_**
  23. R: (Row# of the right alignment die),
  24. C: (Column# of the right alignment die).
  25. For example if you have 10X10 exposures, the right alignment die could be (R=10,C=10) and the left alignment die (R=10,C=1).
  26. _**For wafers**_ : We usually select right and left alignment die bellow the center of wafer, and on the same row. It is practical to select left and right alignment die to be in the last row. This helps to quickly find alignment die, and do alignment.
  27. _**For pieces**_ : We usually select right and left alignment die to be in the last row.
  28. **RIGHT KEY OFFSET** : The key offset is distance from the die (mask, main cell) center to the alignment mark center on the first layer (or the layer you will be aligning to). Enter the number for X, and Y in (mm) at the wafer plane. See picture below for sign convention of an alignment mark placed in _quadrant 1 on the mask_. The picture assumes normal Cartesian coordinates with the center-lines crossing at (0,0) and the mask is chrome-side down and oriented as it would be on the stepper. (This is the same orientation that you will have when viewing your L Edit file).
  29. **SIGN CONVENTION for alignment _key offset_ on mask** (main cell)- insert the photo
  30. **_LEFT ALIGNMENT DIE CENTER_** : Repeat 22 through 29 for the left alignment die. Left and Right Key Offset are always the same, except for jobs with one single exposure (one die), where left and right key offset are different!
  31. **EPI SHIFT** : Skip through epi shift. Hit enter.
  32. <<**PASS** >>
  33. Now you are ready to enter information specific to this pass. This is unique information about the layer being exposed.
  34. **NAME** : Enter the pass name of the layer you are exposing. The pass name can be 1 to 9 alphanumeric characters long. (i.e. 1, 2 or ""mesa"", ""trench"" etc.). Job must have at least one pass. When you expose a job, you will specify it as: **EX JOBNAME\PASS**. ( example: EX TEST123\1)
  35. **PASS COMMENT** : Next enter a pass comment, something like "" Exposing first layer or Exposing trench"" etc. This is not mandatory, but it is useful.
  36. **EXPOSURE (sec)** : Enter exposure time for a resist coated on your wafer.
  37. **FOCUS OFFSET[-50- >+50]**: Enter focus for a resist coated on your wafer.
  38. The best exposure time and\or focus for each resist should be optimized. We have some data available on WIKI available for Si wafers
  39. **USE LOCAL ALIGNMENT**?(Y/*N): Enter **""Y""** or **""N""** for local alignment.
  40. If this is _**a first pass**_ (there is no any pattern on your wafer), you need to select in here **""N""**.
  41. **PASS SHIFT** : Pass shift is a distance from the center of mask plate to the center of layer being exposed. Pass shift is used to shift exposure in the pass by a set amount. If you have multiple layers on a single mask, and only one layer is of interest (this pattern is off-center), you would enter the correct offset to ensure pattern alignment. _See picture below_ for sign convention for pass shifts( X,Y) to place pattern into center of wafer. Enter Pass shift (X,Y) in mm at the wafer plane. This is usually number with 4 decimal points (for example : x= - 4.2550, y= 4.5000). See picture below for sign convention of pass shift for a pattern placed in _quadrant 1_. The picture assumes normal Cartesian coordinates with the center lines crossing at (0,0 ) and the mask is chrome-side down and oriented as it would be on the stepper.
  42. **A-RRAY OR P-LUG** : When ""A"" is entered all sites previously specified will be exposed except dropouts specified later. When P is entered, enter the row and column numbers of die you wish to be exposed. Enter D at the R prompt to display the currently selected die. Press return with a blank entry at the R prompt when finished.
  43. **DROPOUTS** : In the dropout section, sites or entire rows or columns can be removed from the exposure. At the prompt: R enter the row you want to drop. (for example R:1). At the C prompt, enter the columns you want to drop. ( C: 1, C:10). If you want to remove the whole row, you can do this using a dash in between (i.e.3-10). Enter D at the R prompt to view the die that will be exposed. Enter V at the R prompt to see a list of dropouts. Enter ? at the R prompt to put back in the last die that was dropped out. Again hit return with no entry at the R prompt to exit.
  44. **SAVE PASS? (*Y/N)** : Answer ""Y"" to save this pass.
  45. If other passes are desired, at the name prompt, enter the name of the new next pass
  46. If this is **_a second pass_** or any other pass you should repeat steps from (32-44). If the pass information is mostly the same as a previous pass, hit ""Y""at the COPY prompt, and enter the name of the pass to be copied and change the info regarding exposure time and focus. If the pass is different, say ""N"" at the ""COPY"" prompt. Follow instructions to finish writing a new pass. At the end save pass.
  47. If this is **_a second pass_** or any other pass that has a critical alignment (max 0.15um alignment layer to layer), you need to use local alignment mark (DFAS). This would require writing a pass (usually called ""mapping pass""). In this case you need follow next steps:
  48. <<**PASS** >>
  49. **NAME** : Enter the pass name for mapping. You need to give this pass a name that will be related to mapping, something like "" LOCAL"" or ""DFAS"". When you expose a job, you will specify it as **MAP JOBNAME\MAPPING PASS, PASS**. (For example: **MAP TEST123\LOCAL, 2**. Jobname : TEST123, mapping pass: LOCAL, pass=2. Using command MAP will align layer #2 to layer #1 with ~0.15um registration). The name of a mapping pass can be 1 to 9 alphanumeric characters long.
  50. **COPY (Y/*N)** : Enter ""N""
  51. **PASS COMMENT** : Next enter a pass comment, something like ""mapping pass"". This is not mandatory, but it is useful.
  52. **EXPOSURE( SEC)** : hit enter, no value
  53. **FOCUS OFFSET [-50- >+50]**: hit enter, no value
  54. **USE LOCAL ALIGNMENT?(Y/*N)** : Enter **""Y""** for local alignment (DFAS) that needs to be already on a layer that is being used for aligning.
  55. **REVERT TO P-REVIUOS ALIGNMENT OR G-LOBAL** : P (enter **P**)
  56. **NUMBER OF SITES PER DXD ALIGNMENT** : 1
  57. **DIE ALIGNMENT (FZT) OFFSET** : Die Alignment offset is the distance from die(main cell) center to the local alignment mark center (DFAS) on the first layer or the layer you will be aligning to). Enter the alignment mark position in X, and Y in (mm) at the wafer plane. _See picture above_ for sign convention of the global alignment mark being placed next to global alignment mark in _quadrant 1_ on the mask. The picture assumes normal Cartesian coordinates with the center-lines crossing at (0,0) and the mask is chrome-side down and oriented as it would be on the stepper. (This is the same orientation that you will have when viewing your L Edit file). You should run a test sample to determine how well the DFAS system is performing for your mask set and process. You may need a small offset in X, and Y coordinates.
  58. **PASS SHIFT** : Enter values for X, and Y . For mapping pass usually pass shift for X, and Y is (0,0)
  59. **A-RRAY OR P-LUG:** A ( Enter in here **""P""** ). By selecting ""P"" we want to select dies to be used for mapping. Usually we do not use all dies for mapping, just in each row several dies. **Mapping requires** at least **4 dies** to be used for mapping.
  60. **PLUGS** : At the R prompt, enter the R# you want to use for mapping ( for example R:1)
  61. **Y-OFFSET** : Hit enter
  62. At the C prompt, enter the C# you want to use for mapping ( for example C:1)
  63. **X-OFFSET** : Hit enter
  64. When finished , enter D at the R prompt. This will display dies that are selected for mapping.
  65. **SAVE PASS**? (*Y/N). Select ""Y"".
  66. **WRITE TO DISK**? (*Y/N). Select ""Y"".
  67. Before running the job, you should EDIT the job to make sure all info is correct.
  68. **EDITING AN EXISTING JOB** : Use the EDIT command followed by the file name. (Example: EDIT test123)
  69. Scroll through job and all passes and change any desired parameters.
  70. Don’t forget to save the changes.
  71. You are ready.

## About
This is a Materials Research Corporation RIE-51 parallel plate, 13.56 Mhz system used primarily for the etching of InP with CH4/H2/Ar gases, although it can be used to etch As- and Sb-based III-V compounds and a variety of II-VI semiconductors as well. For Al-containing compounds and II-VI compounds, high bias power is required. Tool features include: six inch diameter water cooled cathode/substrate platform, pyrex cylinder for plasma confinement and gas flow control, adjustable cathode-anode spacing, fixed bias or power control and HeNe laser etch monitor with chart recorder. It is diffusion pumped and has no loadlock. Various etching applications have included: in-plane lasers/facets, InP-based HBTs, FET gate recessing, InP-based quantum microcavities, Bragg-Fresnel x-ray lenses and waveguides. 
RIE of InP and related compounds can be achieved with a hydride-based process chemistry of methane/hydrogen with an etching mechanism due to a ""reverse"" metalorganic CVD reaction. Because both etching and deposition occur simultaneously, it is important to use the proper gas flows and to periodically remove any polymer reaction by-products deposited on the non-etched (mask) surfaces. (This system has an additional flow circuit in order to bleed in small amounts, <1 sccm, of O2). Alternatively, one can perform cyclic etching between MHA and O2 to keep polymer formation to a minimum. With this technique selectivity is quite high and anisotropic etching can be achieved. While a metal, dielectric or photoresist may be used as a mask, photoresist should only be used at low bias voltages in order to avoid mask pattern distortions due to reflow. A precoat etch should be done before etching to condition the chamber. 
## Detailed Specifications
  * Etch gases include: CH4, H2, Ar and O2
  * Low 1 E -6 ultimate chamber pressure
  * 13.56 Mhz excitation frequency
  * Sample size limited to approximately 2 inches
  * HeNe and IR laser monitoring for endpoint
  * Automatic tuning network
  * DC Bias or RF power control
  * Masking materials include: Ni, SiON, photoresist (limited to low bias/power)
  * Typical etch conditions for InGaAsP: 
    * 75 mT (CH4/H2/Ar : 4/20/10 sccm)
    * 450v bias
    * ~ 45 nm/min. etch rate

## About
This is a Materials Research Corporation RIE-51 parallel plate, 13.56 MHz system used for etching with fluorine-containing gases (CF4, SF6, and CHF3). The system is used primarily for etching of Si, SiO2, and Si3N4 films. Metals such as tungsten may also be etched. Tool features include: six inch diameter water cooled cathode/substrate platform, pyrex cylinder for plasma confinement and gas flow control, adjustable cathode-anode spacing, fixed DC bias or RF power control and a HeNe laser etch monitor with chart recorder. It is turbo pumped and has no loadlock. 
CF4/O2 and SF6/O2 will etch Si, SiO2 and Si3N4 readily since free fluorine is readily liberated in the plasma. The oxygen (up to 40%) initially enhances the fluorine concentration resulting in a higher etch rate. The oxygen also minimizes polymer formation in CF4/O2. Too much Oxygen will compete for fluorine available, suppressing the etch rate. Argon can be added to increase the physical component of etching. The highest etch rates are achieved with SF6 due to the ease of liberating fluorine compared with CF4. The relative etch rate decreases as one goes from Si to Si3N4 to SiO2. CF4 and CHF3 can be used to selectivity etch SiO2 over Si and resist due to increased polymer formation from the presence of hydrogen. This polymer layer is thicker on Si and resist than on SiO2. The trade-off is selectivity versus sidewall profile as the polymer will result in a tapered wall profile. Also, the polymer can be difficult to remove after etching. 
The etches have good selectivity to many metals and semiconductors such as Ni, Al, Cr, Ti, GaAs, InP, and GaN. The system generally produces anisotropic etch profiles unless one goes into a purely chemical fluorine etch mode with higher pressure SF6 processes. The system also has a strong loading effect so that larger substrates and open areas will require more feed gas and higher pressure to compensate. As a result, individual processes need to be characterized. 
## Detailed Specifications

## About
This computer-controlled, turbo-pumped RIE is the ""work horse"" of the processing laboratory due to it's ease of operation and versatility. It can be operated manually or in a fully programmable mode from sample loading to etching to sample unloading. Samples are placed on a silicon carrier with or without a bonding agent to facilitate sample cooling. Etching is done with oxygen or chlorine-based gases @ 13.56 Mhz. Oxygen is used for etching of photoresists and polyimide. Chlorine-based gases are used for etching semiconductors and some metals. Typical semiconductor materials that are etched are: AlGaAs, InGaAs, AlGaSb, GaN, and Si. Metals that can be etched include Al, Ti, and Cr layers. Good masking materials for the chlorine-based etching are photoresist (at powers < 200 W), Ni, SiO2, and SrF2. The wafer chuck can be heated to 80°C through liquid-based heating. This makes etching of high In-containing compounds difficult due to the non-volatility of In-chlorides. A high physical component (Ar in the mixture) is required for etching of InP and the surface will be contaminated with residual etch products when finished. 
Special features include: a true sample loadlock, substrate backside helium cooling, heating up to 80°C, four inch sample holder, HeNe laser etch monitor and chart recorder. Various devices that use this tool as an integral processing step include: in-plane lasers, VCSELs, micro-lenses, Bragg-Fresnel lens, FETs, HBTs, etc. 
## Detailed Specifications
  * Etch gases include: Cl2, BCl3, SiCl4, O2, Ar
  * Full computer control or manual computer control
  * Low 1 E-7 ultimate chamber pressure
  * 13.56 Mhz excitation frequency
  * Sample chuck He-backside cooled / heated (up to 80°C)
  * Laser Etch monitor: large spot size, no camera/alignment method. 
    * Requires full ~1cm witness sample/area in center of wafer.

# About
Our rapid thermal annealer is manufactured by AET. Heating is achieved through two banks of heat lamps that deliver optical energy through the all-quartz chamber. With this unit, atmospheric pressure anneals in Oxygen, Nitrogen and Forming Gas can be done to temperatures up to 1200°C for three minutes. An inner liner is used to prevent contamination to the main quartz chamber. A thermocouple and pyrometer are available for maintaining temperature control. The system can hold one 4-inch wafer or smaller substrates placed on top of a Silicon carrier wafer. Custom windows based control software has been added to the system by Sedona Visual Controls. All process parameters are monitored and stored. Typical anneals are done for: ohmic contact formation to semiconductors, implant activation, damage annealing, dopant activation, and film densification. A variety of materials can be annealed in the chamber, including Si, SiO2, Si3N4, GaAs, InP, GaSb, GaN, and metals. For materials that will decompose at the elevated temperatures, a dielectric anneal cap must be deposited on the wafer or an enclosed wafer holder must be used to prevent contamination of the chamber walls. 
# Detailed Specifications
  * Maximum ramp rate of 50°C/Sec.
  * Oxygen, Nitrogen and Forming Gas flows up to 10LPM.
  * TC use for anneals up to 1200°C
  * Windows-based process monitoring and control software by Sedona Visual Controls


**Max temp vs time:**
  * 1000°C for 20 min
  * 1100°C for 5 min
  * 1200°C for 3 min

## About
The Solaris 150 is a manual loading “Rapid Therm Process” (RPT) or “Rapid Thermal Anneal” (RTA) system for R&D and pre-production. The Solaris 150 can process up to 152.4mm substrates at a temperature range from RT- 1200 degrees. The unique temperature measurement system of the Solaris requires virtually no calibration for different wafer types and backside emmissivity differences. 
The Solaris uses a unique PID process controller that ensures accurate temperature stability and uniformity. The system can accommodate four interlocked MFCs for gas mixing and forming gas processing. The Solaris is designed for silicon implant annealing and monitoring and compound semiconductor implant activation and ohmic alloying.

### **Procedure:**
  1. Check if the correct user account is selected. Only use the “**UCSB User** ” account. 
    1. Click “Home” -> “Change User”. User Name: “ _UCSB Users_ ”, Password: “ _ucsb_ ”
  2. Make sure the system is not running a process. Lot view shows no wafers or batches running.
  3. Check if PR containers are empty. PR bottles that are available to use are UV6-0.8 in POD#4 and DSK101 in POD#5. If bottles are empty (if you see large bubbles in the supply tube) use the “report tool issue” in signupmonkey. _**Users are not authorized to change or add any chemistries.**_
  4. Check the PR nozzle “bath” (small white tray underneath _Arm 1_). Make sure it’s not clogged (should have a bit of liquid, but not above the drain hole). If the bath is clogged use the “report tool issue” in signupmonkey. Users are not authorized to clean the nozzle bath or the nozzle tips. To unclog or clean, the robot arms need to be raised up. Or else nozzles can get bumped and change its positions. _**Only staff is allowed to manually raise the robot arm and clean the nozzle tips & bath.**_
  5. Make sure all wafers to be used in the S-Cube have extremely clean backsides. If wafers have dirt, clean the backside following the steps given in the “ _How to clean wafer backside before use_ ” section, before using in the S-Cube.
  6. Check if hot plates are set to required temperatures for your process. If not, run Temp-change recipes: 
    1. Note only Hot Plate 4 (HP4) temperature can be changed. HP1(135C), HP2(170C) & HP3(170C) temperatures are set and cannot be changed.
    2. Load dummy wafer (_**With extremely clean underside**_)
    3. Run Staff -> HP4-SET-***C recipe. HP4 can be set to 185C, 200C, 210C or 220C. 
      1. Ex: HP4-SET-220C will set hot plate 4 to 2200C
    4. Check that the hotplate reaches the desired temperature (will overshoot by ~2C - 3C).
    5. After 5 min wafer bake, make sure the temperature is ±2C before running the actual process.
  7. Load a test “mechanical” wafer (_**With extremely clean underside**_) and run a test run of your desired recipe and make sure spin looks ok. This is important for the first UV6-0.8 run after more than 6 hrs of idle time. The 1st mechanical test wafer will likely show radial non uniformity as dried PR is ejected. 2nd test wafer should spin with high uniformity. If the nozzle is clogged, report tool issue in signupmonkey.
  8. Load your wafers into the left Cassette at Load Port 1 (LP1 labeled with “1”).
  9. Select the Route/Chain to run (see available recipes table). Use filter [staff] for all the available routes.
  10. Select wafer slots to run in the LP1 section
  11. Click [Run] to run your route. Do not open the tool door while process is running.

  * Combination of PEB bake and develop: Bake @ 135C 90sec + Develop @ 300rpm @ 10 – 20 sec
  * _**DO NOT run developer recipes that are not in ""UCSB Users""! There are experimental Develop recipes in the other logins that can damage and bring tool down for extended period of time!**_


### **Troubleshooting:**
  1. Air bubbles in the PR, EBR-PG or AZ300MIF tubes. 
    1. Use [Report Tool issue] on SignupMonkey to report the problem & get help.
  2. If PR nozzle bath (small white tray underneath _Arm 1_) or the nozzle tip is clogged. 
    1. Use [Report Tool issue] on SignupMonkey to report the problem & get help.
    2. Users are not authorized to manually raise the nozzle tips and clean them.
  3. Robot arms are not moving after 5min – 10min after starting a route. 
    1. Use [Report Tool issue] on SignupMonkey to report the problem & get help.
    2. Tool may need full system reset. Users are not allowed to manually initialize the tool.
  4. If wafer is lost in tool. 
    1. Use [Report Tool issue] on SignupMonkey to report the problem & get help.
    2. Do not try to retrieve the wafer on your own.
  5. The Run button cannot be toggled after clicking “no” at “Run Selected Route” prompt in LP1. 
    1. Physically remove the black wafer carrier from LP1 and wait for 2 sec.
    2. Put the wafer carrier back in its place in LP1.
    3. LP1 tabs in the Run section will get re-initialized.
  6. Unknowingly ran a developer recipe not in “UCSB Users” login. 
    1. As a precaution, _**DO NOT run developer recipes that are not in ""UCSB Users"" login!**_
    2. Notify staff immediately!
  7. If new or other variations of standard recipe is needed, contact staff.


### **How to clean wafer backside before use:**
  1. Place the wafer upside down in the POLOS spinner using a non-contact chuck.
  2. Set spin speed to 2000 rpm. Program “backside”.
  3. Spin wafer, wait until at top speed.
  4. Squirt “Remover PG” 10 sec, then Acetone 3 seconds, then ISO for 3 sec
  5. Spin Dry while blowing with N2. Wait ~5 sec before stopping spin.

## About
The JEOL IT800HSL Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope is used for imaging a variety of samples made in the facility. 
### Capabilities
The system has multiple detectors, detailed below. Low-vacuum mode reduces sample charging by introducing N2 gas into the chamber, without sacrificing imaging quality (using a special vacuum nozzle on the electron column). Both of these are useful for imaging low conductivity and insulating materials without the need for conductive layer coatings. 
The system can accept a 6” wafer, but only 140mm (X) and 80mm (Y) of the wafer is accessible with the stage movement. 
The [**_Hummer coater_**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/SEM_Sample_Coater_\(Hummer\) ""SEM Sample Coater \(Hummer\)"") is used to deposit a thin AuPd on your samples, to reduce electrical charging of insulating samples (such as SiO2 substrates, or thick >1µm layers of SiO2 or PR). 
This SEM also has an Electron-Beam Lithography Nabity system. Contact Aidan Hopkins for info.

## Operating Procedures
  * [JEOL IT800SHL Operating Procedure](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/1/10/JEOL_IT800SHL_Operating_Procedure.docx).
  *     * Stig is the most common cause of blurry images, and requires practice to improve/knowing what to look for.
    * A Common mistake is to optimize stig on flat lines (eg. a cleaved edge or line/space features). This always leads to accidentally skewing the stig in the direction of the lines. Instead, make sure to optimize on a roundish feature, such as a piece of dust/debris.

# About
This system is for coating thin (1-10nm) AuPd layers onto samples that will reduce charging during FESEM inspection. 
### When to use
If you tried SEM'ing a sample, and the sample appears to drift/move during imaging/capture, or astigmatism is constantly changing, then your sample may be charging up and deflecting the electron beams. This is common for imaging insulators such as substrates made of glass (SiO2), or substrates coated in glass (SiO2, SiN) or thick photoresist (≥1µm). Thin layers (<<1µm) on top of conductive substrates (eg. 200nm SiO2 on Silicon substrate) can often allow electron beams and fields to penetrate to the conductor, possibly not requiring AuPd coating.

## Fabrication Services by NanoFab Staff
_Perform**fabrication services via NanoFab staff** , instead of your staff/employees entering our lab._
### Important Info on Fabrication Services
  * [**Rates are listed here**](https://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/services#comp-k3rx7hk4). 
    * We bill for both ""__Use of Facility + Equipment__ "" **plus** ""__Dedicated staff support__ "" time per hour.
    * This is similar to your own employee using the lab.
    * The technical contact for all work performed by UCSB Nanofab staff must be an employee or paid contractor of the institution that has signed the service agreement with UCSB. **--** **New 2025-02**
    * **We will only apply Academic/Gov't rates** if the technical contact directing the work is at the academic institution we have a signed service agreement with. **--** **New 2025-02**
  * You will work directly with [Demis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") or [his staff](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Staff_List#Process_Group ""Staff List"") to schedule the work, if the project is accepted. 
    * Any project must first be accepted by our Project Scientists.
    * We have limited staff and are not a foundry, and we will only accept jobs that we are capable of performing with success.
  * There is _**no guarantee**_ of research results or success in fabrication. We may also be able to suggest other ways to get your devices made in our lab if Staff use is not appropriate for your project.
  * You will be _billed for the Actual time and materials required during the job_ , regardless of project outcome. 
    * We can provide only a rough _estimate_ of time and cost because it's an hourly service, not a ""quote"".
  * We send out bills monthly, with payment expected as Net30; Credit card payments are accepted.
  * [Publications Policy](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Publications_acknowledging_the_Nanofab ""Frequently Asked Questions"") - fabrication executed by NanoFab Staff is often significant ""_intellectual contribution_ "". Acknowledgement of NanoFab use is required at minimum.


### Request Remote Fabrication Services
_Submitting jobs for ""remote"" fabrication services requires the following steps:_
1. Contact us (
2. Nanofab Staff acceptance of project. 
#### Paperwork for Fabrication Services
3. Submit the [**Project Info and Description Form**](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/7/79/Nanofabrication_Facility_Project_Description.xlsx) (download) to 
  * No signatures required, only project info and contact info for internal billing purposes.


4. Return the [**UCSB Service Agreement**](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/1/1d/UCSB_Service_Agreement.pdf) (download) 
  * Requires signature from your institution (_signature authority required_ , typically _not_ the professor or graduate student. Business or Contracts Bept., for example)


  * Only one agreement is needed per institution. Ask us to find out if your inst. already has one in place.


5. University of California users only: 
  * UC Users - in the Project Description, you will have to provide a valid Recharge Account number to bill against.
  * If you are a **UCSB Group** , we _don't_ need the Service Agreement from you, only the _**Project Info & Description Form**_ (above).
  * If you are a **group from another UC** , we don't need the Service Agreement, instead we need a different form: [The Inter-Campus MOU](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/0/00/Facility-Use-MOU---Intercampus-UC-User.pdf ""Facility-Use-MOU---Intercampus-UC-User.pdf"") signed by the User submitting the job (here is [Attachment A](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/7/7c/Attachment_A_-_UCSB_Master_Facilities_Use_Agreement_Labs.pdf) listing included UCSB facilities.).


#### **Statement of Work**
For each request, please provide a quick PPT/Word/similar doc explaining exactly what you need done (""SOW""), which should include: 
  * Please name your file something like: ""_**2024-08-21** SiO2 Dep **v1**.pptx_"" 
    * We use the approx date as your BatchID
    * Revisions will update only the _v1/2/3_ number, but keep the BatchID the same.
  * How many wafers to run and/or number of samples to be provided.
  * Size/Shape of samples. Eg. ""_4-inch wafers_ "" or ""_irregular ~1cm pieces_ ""
  * Exact processing steps to perform. Staff will assist filling in any missing details. 
    * Please clearly state which steps UCSB Staff will perform, versus steps your staff will perform, if needed.
  * Targets and acceptable tolerances for the main steps, eg. ""_Deposit 500nm of SiO2, acceptable range 450-550nm (±10% tolerance)_ "". 
    * Note that tight tolerances (<<10%) will require us to run additional calibrations at your expense, so please choose a tolerance that is _required_ for your devices to work.
    * It is common to **not know the tolerance** for research devices, so just leave that out and a ""best effort"" is usually acceptable.


##### Example SOWs
For some tools the programming/instructions can be fairly complex - below are examples for tools that require more detailed instructions:

Silicon Deep Etcher (Plasma-Therm SLR),https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Silicon_Deep_Etcher_(Plasma-Therm_SLR),"# Recipes
```
**This tool does not exist in this configuration any more, so these recipes are for Reference purposes Only!!!**
The machine was upgraded to be the new Plasma-Therm Fluorine ICP Etcher - the chamber configuration is now different, making these recipes invalid.
For Deep Silicon Etching, the Plasma-Therm DSE-iii[](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ICP_Etching_Recipes#High_Rate_Bosch_Etch_.28DSEIII.29 ""ICP Etching Recipes"") is often used.  Some single-step Silicon etching is still performed on the SLR Fluorine ICP[](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ICP_Etching_Recipes#Si_Etching_.28Fluorine_ICP_Etcher.29 ""ICP Etching Recipes""), due to the slower etch rate.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

# About
The Three-Target DC/RF Sputtering System, built by Sputtered Films, Inc. is based on the ""Research S-Gun"" and as such, is capable of high sputtering rates (~ A/min.) for metal, semiconductor and dielectric materials with a minimal substrate bombardment caused by secondary electrons. The deposition chamber is non-loadlocked providing for easy sample loading and target/gun changing. Venting and evacuation are automated with a 500 l/s turbo (capable of pumping O2) achieving an ~ 2 E-7 T ultimate pressure (~ 1E-7 with liquid nitrogen flange pocket) in about 6-8 hours. Substrates are clip mounted onto one of several 6 inch diameter platens which mount into a rotating 4-position planetary ""flat-wheel"". This flat-wheel is concentric with a rotating 3-blade shutter assembly. Each are then manually positioned over one of three sputtering guns, operating one at a time. Available gases for injection include Ar/N2/O2, the latter allowing for nitride and oxide formation. Flow rates of <100 sccm are controlled with standard mass flow controllers. Gun power supplies include: 2.4 kW DC magnetron driver, 13.56 Mhz RF supply for sample sputter cleaning, and a SparcLE Pulsed DC Unit for reactive sputter deposition. Operation is usually in a constant power mode (200-500 watts) with the resulting optimum V, I (and chamber pressure) dependent on the target material. Present available targets include: Al, Al(0.5% Cu or 4% Cu), Ag, Au, Cr, ITO, Nb, Si, Ti, W, W-Si and Zr-Y. 
# Detailed Specifications
  * 3 target with DC or Pulsed-DC operation
  * Low E-7 T ultimate pressure (10 mT typical operating pressure)
  * 6"" diameter sample holder platen with 4"" sample-gun spacing
  * Deposition uniformity is ~ 85% over 2 "" diameter for SiO2 deposition at 300W

# About
The Six-Target DC/RF Sputtering System, built by AJA International uses planar magnetron sources. The sources are contained in tiltable sputter gun modules that allow for maintaining uniformity control at various sample heights. Cross contamination between sources is minimized by using a chimney configuration with very narrow source shutter gaps. Uniformity is better than 2% over 90mm. 
2 DC sources and 2 RF sources allow for co-deposition of materials, including dedicated magnetic films Fe, Ni, and Co. 
Other materials, such as ITO, Si, Al, Zr, etc. can be reactively RF sputtered in an O2 or N2 environment to produce metal-oxides or nitrides. Argon is used for the sputter gas, with N2 and O2 used for reactive sputtering. 
The deposition chamber is loadlocked providing for fast substrate transfer and consistent, low base pressure. Venting and evacuation are automated with a 1200 l/s turbo (capable of pumping O2) achieving an ~ 4.0 E-8 T ultimate pressure. A VAT adaptive pressure control valve is used for process pressure control independent of gas flow. Substrates are clip mounted onto 4 inch carriers. Flow rates are controlled with standard mass flow controllers. 
Gun power supplies include: 500W DC, 13.56 Mhz 300W RF, and a 50W substrate RF supply for in-situ substrate biasing and pre-cleaning. Samples can be heated to 650°C. The system is recipe driven and computer controlled for reproducible results.

# About
The Six-Target DC/RF Sputtering System, built by AJA International uses planar magnetron sources. The sources are contained in tiltable sputter gun modules that allow for maintaining uniformity control at various sample heights. Cross contamination between sources is minimized by using a chimney configuration with very narrow source shutter gaps. Uniformity is better than 2% over 90mm. 
2 DC sources and 2 RF sources allow for co-deposition of materials, including dedicated magnetic films Fe, Ni, and Co. 
Other materials, such as ITO, Si, Al, Zr, etc. can be reactively RF sputtered in an O2 or N2 environment to produce metal-oxides or nitrides. Argon is used for the sputter gas, with N2 and O2 used for reactive sputtering. 
The deposition chamber is loadlocked providing for fast substrate transfer and consistent, low base pressure. Venting and evacuation are automated with a 1200 l/s turbo (capable of pumping O2) achieving an ~ 4.0 E-8 T ultimate pressure. A VAT adaptive pressure control valve is used for process pressure control independent of gas flow. Substrates are clip mounted onto 4 inch carriers. Flow rates are controlled with standard mass flow controllers. 
Gun power supplies include: 500W DC, 13.56 Mhz 300W RF, and a 50W substrate RF supply for in-situ substrate biasing and pre-cleaning. Samples can be heated to 650°C. The system is recipe driven and computer controlled for reproducible results.

The sources are contained in tiltable sputter gun modules that allow for maintaining uniformity control at various sample heights. Cross contamination between sources is minimized by using a chimney configuration with very narrow source shutter gaps. Uniformity better than 2% is achieved for various sample heights. 
Substrates are clip mounted onto 4"", 6"" or a generic carrier. Up to 6"" round wafer sizes can be accomodated in the system. 
2 DC sources and 1 RF sources allow for co-deposition of materials. Materials, such as ITO, Si, Al, Zr, etc. can be reactively RF sputtered in an O2 or N2 environment to produce metal-oxides or nitrides. Flow rates are controlled with standard mass flow controllers. Argon is used for the sputter gases, with N2 and O2 used for reactive sputtering. 
The deposition chamber is load-locked, with automatic wafer transfer, providing for fast substrate transfer and consistent, low base pressure. Venting and evacuation are automated with a 1200 l/s turbo (capable of pumping O2) achieving < 5 E-8T ultimate pressure. A VAT gate valve is used for process pressure control independent of gas flow. 
Gun power supplies include: 300W DC, 13.56 Mhz 300W RF and a 150W substrate RF supply for in-situ substrate biasing and pre-cleaning. Samples can be heated to 800°C. The system is recipe driven and computer controlled for reproducible results.

### Tips & Tricks
#### Ignition Issues
It is somewhat common that you might have a plasma ignition failure at some point. Common remedies for this are to increase the chamber pressure just for the ignition step, then drop dow to the process pressure in the PreClean and/or Dep step. For example, set the ignition step pressure to 10mTorr or 30mT, then during deposition decrease the pressure to 3mTorr and the plasma will stay lit.

## SiOxNy deposition (IBD)
These are some old (2010), initial characterizations only. A recipe improvement would be to increase the Assist O2+N2 = 60sccm total, increasing repeatability by getting away from the low-flow limit of the MFC's. Data provided by [Demis D.

## Standard Cleaning Procedure (IBD)
You must edit the ""_#_GridClean_ ""(""#"" is your group number) steps in your Process according to the following times: 
  * 5min GridClean for 1hr or less deposition
  * 10min GridClean for up to 2hrs of dep.
  * Do not deposit for longer than 2hrs - instead break up your Process into multiple 2-hr subroutines with cleans in between. See the recipe ""_1_SiO2_Dep_Multi_ "" for an example.

## Basic Editing
### Editing an Existing Page
The First step is to log in: 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/e/e1/Wiki-_Log_In_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_4.14.49_PM.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Wiki-_Log_In_-_Screen_Shot_2017-11-30_at_4.14.49_PM.png)
All active NanoFab users can make a login - see [this FAQ](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_get_a_login_to_the_wiki.3F ""Frequently Asked Questions"") for how to do that. 
Then navigate to the page you want to edit. 
Once you are at the page, click on ""_**Edit**_ "" to launch the _Edit Source_ "", allows you to edit the **not recommended**. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/7/7a/Basic1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Basic1.png)Click Edit.
After clicking _[Edit]_ , you will be able to type directly into the page to make your changes. 
There are a couple of key things to note on this page. 
Press the **[ < Back]** button on your web browser to cancel/discard any changes you made.  
**Save page** : Clicking this will save any and all changes you have made.  
**Show preview** : This will show you a preview of what the page will look like after you save it.  
**Show changes** : This will give you a before and after comparison of the page.  
**Cancel** : This will cancel any changes.  

  * The Visual Editor opened by hitting _[Edit]_ is pretty self-explanatory for most purposes. See the 
  * Please use **Show Preview** to make sure your edits look as expected.
  * Be sure to enter a brief _description of what you changed_ , so Editors can approve you changes quickly.


The two editing methods: 
Using the Visual Editor on a text page, via the **[Edit]** tab (recommended): 
[![Visual Editor in action, animated](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/39/VisualEditor_In_Action_v1.gif/650px-VisualEditor_In_Action_v1.gif)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:VisualEditor_In_Action_v1.gif)
(_Not recommended_) The _**[Edit Source]**_ mode, showing wikimarkup source code for the page. _[Rich Editor]_ provides some code shortcuts: 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/da/Basic2.png/650px-Basic2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Basic2.png)
We do have some old antiquated ""coded"" parts of the site, which are holdovers from before we installed the modern ""Visual Editor"". Due to existing page linking/URLs, many of these can't be changed (such as code used for superscripts and subscripts in page names). 
### Making a New Page
Only Staff & Admins can make new pages. If you want to do this but don’t have permission, please let the [wiki admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") know and we’ll be happy to help you complete your edits. 
The preferred way to make a new page is to first create a Link to a page that doesn't exist (within an existing page), and then follow that Link to create the new page. Do this as follows: 
  1. On the existing page, [Edit] the page, and type the text you would like to become a hyperlink.
  2. Select the desired text, and click the Hyperlink button [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8c/Editing_Toolbar_Hyperlink_Button_01.png/24px-Editing_Toolbar_Hyperlink_Button_01.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Toolbar_Hyperlink_Button_01.png) which pops up the link panel.
  3. Type the _**desired name of the new page**_ into the ""search"" field - it will show a red link in the search field, indicating that the page doesn't exist yet. [![Screenshot of hyperlink panel, Creating a hyperlink to a nonexisting page.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/da/Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_01.png/300px-Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_01.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_01.png)Creating a hyperlink to a nonexisting page.
  4. Click the Red Link in the menu, which then sets this as the target of your Hyperlink.[![Screenshot showing Hyperlink panel to nonexisting page - Showing Arrow to CLICK on RedLink](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/94/Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_02_-_CLICK_arrow.png.png/300px-Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_02_-_CLICK_arrow.png.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorial_-_Hyperlink_panel_nonexisting_page_02_-_CLICK_arrow.png.png)Click on the RedLink in the search results.
  5. Save the changes you have made to this page.
  6. After Saving the page, you will see a ""Red Link"" - _**colored red because it leads to a nonexistent page.**_ [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/b1/RedLink_Screenshot.png/189px-RedLink_Screenshot.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:RedLink_Screenshot.png)A ""red link"", linking to a nonexistent page.
  7. Click the red-link to the nonexistent page, which will show an option to create the new page.
  8. Click [Create] to make the new page in VisualEditor mode (defaults to Source mode, which is not recommended). [![Screenshot showing to Click on ""Create"" Tab to enter VisualEditing Mode](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/bc/Click_on_%22Create%22_Tab_to_enter_VisualEditing_Mode.png/506px-Click_on_%22Create%22_Tab_to_enter_VisualEditing_Mode.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Click_on_%22Create%22_Tab_to_enter_VisualEditing_Mode.png)Click on the ""Create"" Tab to enter VisualEditing Mode
  9. Make sure to ""Save"" the new page!


### Inserting images into a page
Only Staff & Admins May upload files. If you want to do this but don’t have permission, please let the [wiki admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") know and we’ll be happy to help you complete your edits. 
There are numerous ways to insert an image into a page you are editing. Here we describe one method only that is the easiest to follow. 
In addition, there are various options that allow you to insert the image inline with text, or on it's own line with a caption+border, or off to the side with text flowing around it. These are each described at the bottom. 
  1. You should be in VisualEditor mode on the page, not source mode. Click the **|Create|** tab to enter VisualEditor mode.
  2. Place your text cursor in the location you would like to insert the image.
  3. In the VisualEditor toolbar, click _**Insert > Media**_. You can insert your image in two ways 
    1. If the image is already uploaded to the server, use the ""__Search__ "" tab to find it and select it.
    2. If you would like to upload a new image from your computer, switch to the ""__Upload__ "" tab > (Choose File) to select the file on your computer, and upload it. Please give it a filename that begins with the purpose of the image, eg. ""_LEXT Instructions - Cancel button.jpg_ "" or ""_E-Beam1 Tool Photograph.png_ "". This makes it easy to search for your image, and know what it is used for (and it won't get accidentally deleted this way!).
  4. Click ""_**Use This Image**_ "". The Image's ""**Media Settings** "" window will automatically pop up. The ""**General Settings** "" fields are optional.
  5. Switch to the ""**Advanced Settings** "" panel 
    1. If you want to have the image ""float"" to any convenient place on the page, leave **[√] Wrap text around this item** enabled. See the ""Floating image"" example to the right → [![floating happy mac image](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/8/8b/MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)""Floating"" Image example
      1. To include a caption, use the **Thumbnail** image type, and set the caption in the **General Settings** pane.
    2. If you want the image to show up in-line with your text, like this: [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8b/MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png/20px-MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:MacOS_-_Happy_Mac.png)
      1. Uncheck **[√]_Wrap text around this item_**
      2. Choose ""frameless"" or ""basic"" image type
    3. Optionally click _**Image Size > Custom**_ and reduce _only_ _one_ of the sizes until the image size looks good. 
      1. Image Widths (1st field) of about 200-600px look good as stand-alone images, floating on the page.
      2. Image Heights (2nd field) of about 10-40px look good inline next to text.
  6. Click _**Insert**_ to insert the image. You can always Double-Click the image or Choose the _**Edit**_ button to change these settings again.


### Linking to a PDF or other file
First you upload the PDF (or other acceptable file type), and copy the link to the newly uploaded PDF, and then paste that link into your Wiki page. It is useful to do this with two separate windows open, one for editing the wiki page you want to add a link on, and another for uploading the file. 
  1. Make sure you are logged in. If you get logged out during this process, don't close any windows, [instead follow this](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#.22Something_went_wrong.22_while_saving_my_edits.21_How_do_I_keep_my_edits.3F).
  2. Optionally, _**open a new web-browser window**_ for performing the file upload.
  3. In the left sidebar, near the bottom, click **Upload FIle**     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/0/09/Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_1-_upload_file.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_1-_upload_file.png)
  4. Click **[Choose File]** and select the file from your computer you want to upload.     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/02/Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_2-_choose_file.png/238px-Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_2-_choose_file.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_2-_choose_file.png)
  5. **Enter the filename** you'd like the file to have once it is on the server. Something simple like ""ToolName - SOP.pdf"" etc. Make sure you keep the same file extension. Also Enter a **Description** of the file, can be as simple as the above. This makes it searchable on the wiki.      [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/85/Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_3b-_filename_descript_upload_button.png/300px-Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_3b-_filename_descript_upload_button.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_Upload_PDF_-_3b-_filename_descript_upload_button.png)   

  6. Click the **[Upload]** button, and wait for the upload to complete (after which a new page will show). 
    1. If it shows a warning, choose **[Submit modified filename/description]**         [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/f4/Editing_Tutorials_3c-_modifications_etc..png/500px-Editing_Tutorials_3c-_modifications_etc..png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_3c-_modifications_etc..png)
  7. On the resulting _File Info_ page, right-click the file link and **Copy Link/URL**.     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/5a/Editing_Tutorials_4b-_file_info_right_click_URL.png/380px-Editing_Tutorials_4b-_file_info_right_click_URL.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_4b-_file_info_right_click_URL.png)
  8. Back on the wiki page you're editing, select the text you want to link, and paste in the URL as an _External Link_.     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Editing_Tutorials_-_5-_insert_link_into_page.png/400px-Editing_Tutorials_-_5-_insert_link_into_page.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_5-_insert_link_into_page.png)


#### Linking to a file you already uploaded
If you already uploaded the file and now need to link to it, you can find the uploaded file and copy the link as follows: 
  1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom section ""**Tools** "", click ""**Upload File** "".
  2. On that page, click the link for ""**List of Uploaded Files** "" in the 2nd sentence.
  3. Locate your file in the list.
  4. Click the Title of the file, which brings you to the File's _File Info_ page - same as the above procedure (Step 7).     [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/4b/Editing_Tutorials_-_List_of_Uploaded_Files_-_click_the_file_title_to_get_file_page.png/625px-Editing_Tutorials_-_List_of_Uploaded_Files_-_click_the_file_title_to_get_file_page.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Editing_Tutorials_-_List_of_Uploaded_Files_-_click_the_file_title_to_get_file_page.png)
  5. From here, follow Step 7 above onwards - you can now copy the directly link to the file itself, and insert into your desired Wiki page, as described above.


### Updating an uploaded file to a new version
You can replace an uploaded file with a new version. This means any links will now point to the new version. 
  * Find the ""File:"" page for the existing file on the wiki. Do this by: 
    * Searching the Wiki for the _file name_ of the original file, or part of the file name. **Hit [Enter] in the search bar** to show all search results.
    * In the search results, click on the Wiki-Page of your File - it will begin with ""**File:** "", such as ""File: My Photo.jpg""
    * Under ""File History"", click ""**upload new version** "".
    * Upload your new version of the file. It will automatically have exact same destination file name on the server, so all links to the file will still work.
    * (It can take ~1 day for user's web browsers to stop using cached old versions of the file.)


## Administration
### Approving Edits (Staff/Admin only)
While lab users are allowed to modify the wiki, their edits will not become visible to anyone until a staff member approves those edits. (When any member of the staff edits a page, those edits are automatically approved.) 
**NOTE TO** **STAFF:** **Take care to watch for approvals before editing** because if a page has edits waiting to be approved and you edit the page normally, those edits will automatically be approved!! Before you edit a page, always make sure that there are no new revisions waiting to be approved (this is described below). 
When you arrive at a page, you will see one of two messages. Either **""No new revisions""** or **""THERE ARE NEW REVISIONS TO THIS PAGE.""**. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/5/5f/Approve1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve1.png)No new revisions. |  [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/c7/Approve2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve2.png)THERE ARE NEW REVISIONS TO THIS PAGE.  
---|---  
If there are new revisions, click on the **history** tab. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/5/52/Approve3.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve3.png)History tab.
This will take you to the full edit history of the page. You will see an entry that has a star on it, this is the current approved revision. Anything after that (above it) has not yet been approved. Put the LEFT radial button on the currently approved revision and set the right radial button anywhere above it to compare other additions. Click ""**Compare selected revisions** "". 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/2d/Approve4.png/1000px-Approve4.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve4.png)History
The window will show you the before (on the left) and the after (on the right). You can also scroll down to see how the NEW page actually looks (AFTER the edit you are view has taken effect). In this case, the user ""Guest"" has deleted the sentence ""The Sharon is a cryo-pumped thin film evaporator with a Temescal four hearth 270° bent beam evaporation source."" and has inserted the sentence ""THIS IS A TEST"". If you like the edit and want to keep it, go back (by pressing the back button in your web-browser) and then click approve next to the edit in question. If you do NOT like the edit, click ""**undo** "", then scroll to the bottom of the page that opens and click save. If you like part of the edit but want to modify it, approve it, then edit the page as you normally would. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/8/8d/Approve5.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Approve5.png)
### My Watchlist
Your watchlist is the set of pages that you are ""watching"" for changes. You can view you watchlist at any time by clicking the link in the top right of the screen. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/a/a1/Watch1.png/400px-Watch1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Watch1.png)
I strongly recommend that you each add your tools to your watch list. This will allow you to see whenever these pages are modified by a user. To add a page to your watch list, go to the page you want to add and click on ""**watch** "" at the top of the page. (To remove a page from you watchlist, do the same thing, the button will read ""**unwatch** "" instead.) 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/12/Watch2.png/400px-Watch2.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Watch2.png)
You can also set it up so that you will recieve an e-mail any time one of the pages on your watchlist is changed (by someone other then yourself). I would also HIGHLY recommend doing this. These emails will come from NanofabWiki@ece.ucsb.edu so you can setup a filter and put all these e-mails in one folder. You will only receive one e-mail per page between visits. In other words if 10 people make changes back to back. You will only get ONE e-mail notifying you that a change has been made, not 10 e-mails. As soon as you view the page form your account, that resets so any changes made after you view it will result in another, single e-mail. 
To set this up go to your preferences by click on the ""**my preferences** "". 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/44/Watch3.png/400px-Watch3.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Watch3.png)
In your preferences you will find a lot of options. The 2 that you need to take care of are your e-mail address (enter it into the box labeled ""E-mail"") and you need to check the box next to ""E-mail me when a page on my watch-list is changed."" Save the changed by clicking ""Save"" at the bottom of the page. 
### Editing Restrictions
To prevent unauthorized editing on the site, we have setup 4 different user groups. These restrictions only pertain to EDITING. 
1) **Annonymous/Unregistered users**     Anyone not registered or not logged in will not be able to edit anything on the site.
2) **Lab Users**     This is anyone who we know to be doing research in the lab (names taken from SignupMonkey). They are allowed to edit existing pages but are not allowed to upload files or create new pages. All edits by _Lab Users_ have to be approved by staff members before they are viewable on the site.
3) **Staff**     This group consist of all staff members. Staff will be able to edit 95% of the pages on the wiki. There are a select few pages on the site that are locked. For example, on the [Main Page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Main_Page ""Main Page""), _Staff_ do not have the option to ""EDIT"" the page, only the option to ""VIEW SOURCE""
4) **Administrators**     This group is for the people in charge of maintaining the nitty-gritty of the site. They have unrestricted access and can change anything on the site. They can also change the ""user group level"" for any user.
## Troubleshooting / FAQ
### It won't let me ""Save"" my changes!
Sometimes the web server logs you out due to ""inactivity"" when you are actually just spending a long time editing a page. Thus, when you try to ""_**save page**_ "", you get an error like ""you are not authorized to edit this page"" since it thinks you're not logged in. 
This is the typical error: 
```
We could not save your edit because the session was no longer valid. Do you want to save this page as an anonymous user instead? Your IP address will be recorded in this page's edit history.

```

If this happens, do Not close the window with your unsaved edits! 
A quick workaround is to open a New web-browser window, navigate to the [wiki](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Main_Page ""Main Page"") and [log in there](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Special:UserLogin ""Special:UserLogin""). After a few seconds, try saving the edited page again, and it should work this time. You may have to hit ""_**Try Again**_ "" for it to work. 
If this does not work, you want to be sure you don't lose all your hard work! One way to do this is to copy the Wiki Code into a text file on your computer, as follows: If you are using the VisualEditor (default), switch to Source Code view via the _**Pen button**_ [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/b5/Visual_Editor_-_switch_to_source_mode_-_pen_button.png/38px-Visual_Editor_-_switch_to_source_mode_-_pen_button.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Visual_Editor_-_switch_to_source_mode_-_pen_button.png) > _**[Source Editing]**_ , then _**Select All**_ and _**Copy**_ the code for the page. Then paste it into a NotePad.exe or TextEdit.app window on your computer (optionally save the file to your computer somewhere). 
Then, once you have managed to log back into the Wiki, you can edit the '_**Source**_ ' of the page and _**paste**_ your source code in the appropriate place. Be sure to ""Preview"" the results to make sure it worked as expected, and that you pasted into the right spot! 
### I can't upload my file - it says the file is too large
For uploaded files, there is a maximum file size limit and a limited list of allowed file types, to prevent hacking and viruses. If you run into one of these limitations please contact the [Wiki Admin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wiki_Admin ""Wiki Admin"") and they can help you get the file uploaded and properly linked.

# About
The DektakXT is a profilometer for measuring step heights or trench depths on a surface. This is a surface contact measurement technique where a very low force stylus is dragged across a surface. The DektakXT offers Windows based data acquisition, data analysis, and equipment control. The force of the tip on the surface is adjustable from .03 mg to 15 mg, allowing for the measuring of hard and soft surfaces. A stress measurement option is also included with this tool. The profilometer can measure to a depth of over 1 mm, allowing for direct measurement of MEMS type structures. Lateral resolution is tip-shape dependent and vertical resolution is 1A (when using the 6.55 um range). The lateral resolution is limited by the tip shape. A video camera with variable magnification allows for manual placement of the stylus using the manual X, Y, Theta stage. Software analysis can determine roughness, average step height, etc.

Our GCA wafer stepper is an i-line (365 nm) step and repeat exposure tool for doing lithography that requires high resolution and/or critical alignment. The system has been modified to accept piece parts (down to ~15 mm x 15 mm) up to 6” diameter wafers using manual wafer loading. The maximum square die size is 14.8mm x 14.8mm. The system has an Olympus 2142 (N.A. = 0.42) lens that reduces the mask image by 5 x and gives an ultimate resolution of ~ 0.5 um in the center of the lens field. The system can easily produce 0.7 um isolated lines across the entire field. Autofocus is used to determine the sample surface relative to the lens, making the focus stable and repeatable for different thickness of wafer. The stages are controlled by stepper motors and laser interferometers. Using the global, manual alignment, better than 0.25 um alignment error is achievable. Using the DFAS local alignment system, alignment error better than 0.15 um is achieved. With the 350 W Hg arc lamp, we get approximately 180 mW/cm² of i-line intensity at the wafer. 
The system is computer controlled with the capability to program and save a wide variety of exposure jobs. We also have unlimited phone support for system problems through a service contract. The laboratory contains a variety of i-line compatible photoresists. SPR955CM-0.9 for 0.7-1.0 um thick positive processes. AZ5214E for 1.0-2.0 um thick image reversal (negative) process. SPR955CM-1.8 for 1.5-2.0 um thick positive processes. SPR220-3 for 2.5-5 um thick positive process. SPR220-7 for > 5 um thick positive processes. AZnLOF5510 for 1.0um and AZnLOF 2020 for 1.5-3 um negative resist process. Shipley LOL-2000 is also used as an underlayer for high resolution lift-off processes.

## **Resist spin coating and cleaning the back-side of wafer**
The substrate (wafer or a piece part) needs to be clean prior spinning resist. This could be simply ACE/IPA clean followed by dehydration bake. If the back side of the substrate has some resist residue or particulates, this can cause errors in the interpreted best focus point since the substrate surface may be at a different height. 
  1. Make sure all work surfaces (spin chucks, hot plates, metal surfaces) are clean
  2. Spin coat resist following the recipe for spinning/baking specific resist (make sure the resist is fresh)
  3. Check back-side of the substrate thoroughly for resist residue/particulates before loading into system
  4. If you see particulates, try to blow it off with high N2 flow first, you may need a razor blade to remove stubborn particles
  5. If you see resist residue on 4""wafer, do next: 
    1. Place wafer upside down in POLOS spinner using non-contact chuck
    2. Set spin speed to 2000rpm
    3. Spin wafer, wait until at top speed
    4. Squirt Acetone on sample back for 3 seconds, followed by ISO for 3 sec
    5. Spin Dry while blowing with N2
  6. Load the wafer on chuck and then stage
  7. Small and fragile substrates cannot be cleaned using POLOS (use Q-tip and gently swab the back side)


## **Logging into computer and checking the system**
The system administrator will set up a directory for you to LOG IN and use the stepper at the time of training. 
  1. At the colon log into the system using **LOG IN [10,1]**
  2. Type **MODE** and scroll down through options
  3. Select the chuck size. Use **100** for 4"" substrates and **3** for 3"" or smaller substrates.This number is used for telling the system where the chuck center is.
  4. DO NOT change any parameters in here, except _**the chuck size**_
  5. Log out using **LOG OUT**
  6. At the colon sign type **LOG IN [10,xxx]** , and hit enter. ( xxx-your account )
  7. Type **ORIG** and hit enter. This resets the laser interferometer position measurement system and moves the stage through its entire motion.


## **Reticle Loading and Unloading**
The alignment of the reticle (mask) to the system is critical for achieving reproducible alignment. System alignment marks on the reticle are located near the right and left edges of the mask and are 103 mm apart so they do not get exposed within the 100 mm exposure area of the mask. These marks are put on automatically by Photronix and the gds file can be obtained from Brian Thibeault if you use a different vendor. Use the following procedure to align the mask correctly to the system. 
**Loading the reticle:**
  1. Unlock spindle and swing lamp column to middle position so that the lens is exposed.
  2. Place mask chrome side down so that wording appears correct ( as seen in L-edit file).
  3. Swing lamp column so that objective can be used to align mask, DO NOT tighten spindle lock at this time.
  4. Using your hands and looking through microscope, shift and rotate mask so that the “crosses” are roughly aligned
  5. Tighten spindle lock. This releases a vacuum holder onto the top of the mask so that the mask may be precisely aligned.
  6. Looking through microscope, use alignment knobs (x,y) to translate and rotate(Θ) the mask into position. First focus the objective by using the knob on top of the microscope. Use the right alignment mark for the x-axis alignment and both alignment marks for the y-axis and rotation alignments. **NOTE:** To get best and fastest results approach alignment from one direction, do not try to wiggle back and forth about the alignment position. Backlash in the mechanics can make this frustrating. You should see equal amounts of light in between all lines when the mask is aligned well (within 0.1 um).
  7. Once mask is aligned, pull the reticle vacuum button to the left of the lens column. The reticle is now vacuumed to the system.
  8. Use the stencil (usually L-shape mask cover), to cover part of the mask plate that you do NOT want to be exposed. If you have just one layer on your mask plate, you do not need to use the stencil. There are also blade apertures that could be used. The knobs on the lamp column (X,Y) can be adjusted to 100,75,50 and 25% to be open. Fully open blade apertures would be at 100%
  9. You are now ready to proceed with a focus job, map job, or exposure job.
  10. **This part is important:** If alignments are critical, do not just brush through this procedure. The global alignment requires good, precise alignment of the reticle with the system in order to work correctly. The local alignment system can adjust for local X and Y misalignment, but not rotational errors.


**Unloading the reticle:**
  1. Unlock spindle and swing lamp column to middle position so that the lens is exposed.
  2. Pull the reticle vacuum button to the left of the lens column. Unload the reticle from the system.
  3. Swing the lamp column back. Tighten spindle lock.


## **Loading a wafer into the system**
  1. Attach the appropriate chuck to the system. 
    1. See the link [How to select proper chuck](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_1_\(GCA6300\)_How_to_select_proper_chuck ""Stepper 1 \(GCA6300\) How to select proper chuck"")
    2. Make sure you know your substrate thickness and wafer diameter.
    3. **TARGET thickness** **is** : **6.121mm +/- 0.1mm (TARGET= Chuck thickness+ Substrate thickness)**
    4. Each chuck has two numbers on top side (for example **76mm/635um**) showing wafer diameter, and substrate thickness. See the link [Available chucks](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_1_\(GCA_6300\)_Available_chucks ""Stepper 1 \(GCA 6300\) Available chucks"")
      1. If your sample is thin (150um thinner than the number on top side of chuck), then you need to use **SHIM (we have 230, 260 and 400um shims)**
      2. See this link for a detailed table of [Substrate Thickness, Shim Thickness ans Target Thickness](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_1_\(GCA_6300\)_Substrate_Thickness,_Shim_Thickness_ans_Target_Thickness ""Stepper 1 \(GCA 6300\) Substrate Thickness, Shim Thickness ans Target Thickness"")
      3. If you need a shim with different thickness you can try cutting some shim stock (stored in drawer next to Autostep200).
  2. Place your wafer centered on the chuck, noting the orientation. If you are doing an alignment step, make sure to place the wafer in the same orientation and as best as possible in the same location as the first exposure. The set screws in the chuck can help to get reproducible placement of the wafer. When the wafer is in place, flip the right vacuum switch upwards to hold the sample.
  3. Place the sample chuck onto the stage, again trying to be repeatable, and flip the left vacuum switch upwards to hold the chuck.
  4. Now you are ready to do an exposure job.


## **Running a JOB-Normal Operation**
  1. At the colon sign type **LOG IN [10,xxx]** , and hit enter. ( xxx-group/company account)
  2. Load the sample on chuck and then on stage
  3. The command you will use for _**Global alignment is:**_
  4. **EX jobname\passname** and hit enter
  5. (See bellow “ _**Wafer alignment to system"" - for Global Alignment , and "" Wafer alignment to mask""- for Local Alignment (DFAS)** ” )_
  6. Type in the desired exposure time
  7. Type in desired focus offset
  8. Press RESET on the small keyboard
  9. Press MAN and S/C simultaneously
  10. Wait about 5-10 seconds
  11. Press MAN
  12. Sample will move to alignment position/do global alignment
  13. Now you can proceed to the wafer alignment to system


  * **WAFER ALIGNMENT TO SYSTEM /_Global (Manual Operation Only_)**


The joysticks and focus knobs are used in this part of the exposure sequence to align the wafer to the system. The sequence of operations will depend on whether or not you use standard alignment keys (global alignment mark) or not. If you place the sample close to the position you did during the first exposure, you should see an alignment mark in the right side of the screen. If not, you will need to find this mark using the position joystick by following a spiraling outward from the initial position. Pressing “F” repeatedly on the keyboard will do this spiral finding for you automatically. The joysticks have a double speed. Press joystick far for the high speed, shallow for the low speed. To change the joystick speed hit letter **""O""** on the main keyboard. The joystick speed is in range from 1-10 (1- slowest, 10-fastest). Once the alignment mark is found follow one of the following procedures. Most of the time we use **_Non-Standard Alignment keys_** : 
_**Standard Alignment Keys:**_
  1. Adjust the focus knob to get a crisp image (knob on top of the microscope piece).
  2. Align the right alignment mark using the position joystick.
  3. Use the Theta joystick to rotate the left image into position. [Positive Theta = CW , Negative Theta= CCW rotation of chuck]. 
  4. If you run out of theta alignment, you will need to adjust your sample on the chuck by hand, and continue with alignment until aligned very well.
  5. The left image(left side of monitor) is used for theta _only_. The right image(right side of monitor) is used for x, and y alignment. Use the right image to do your best alignment. This step is important.
  6. Repeat process until satisfied with the alignment. You can obtain better than 0.2 um alignment consistently if you are careful with reticle and global alignment.


_**Non-Standard Alignment Keys**_ : 
  1. Adjust the focus knob to get a crisp image (knob on top of the microscope piece).
  2. Align the right mark using the position joystick.
  3. Press ""A"" on the main keyboard to toggle to the left alignment mark.
  4. Use the theta joystick to rotate the left image into position. [Positive Theta = CW , Negative Theta= CCW rotation of chuck].
  5. If you run out of theta alignment, you will need to adjust your sample manually on the chuck, and continue with alignment until aligned very well.
  6. The left image(left side of monitor) is used for theta only. The right image(right side of monitor) is used for x, and y alignment. Use the right image( right side of monitor) to do your best alignment. This step is important.
  7. Press ""A"" again to move to the right alignment mark
  8. Again adjust the right alignment mark
  9. Repeat process until satisfied with alignment.
  10. Once alignment is finished, you have two option for piece parts (quarters): BR orientation, and BL orientation.
  11. **BR orientation** - make sure you are on right alignment mark before pressing "" EXP"", **BL orientation** - make sure you are on left alignment mark before pressing "" EXP"". In both cases do your best alignment, but verify final alignment looking at the right image(right side of monitor).
  12. After global alignment, press EXP on small keyboard and the job will be executed.
  13. Remove the sample from the stage when done.
  14. Develop resist and inspect in microscope for alignment (if needed).
  15. Computer may ask for next wafer. To escape out of this press CTRL C followed by A and the enter key to abort out of the loop. If you have another wafer with the same job\pass, you can do it now without aborting.


  * **WAFER ALIGNMENT TO MASK /_Local Alignment (DFAS_**) :


The best way to use this is to use _a mapping routine_ followed by a shoot using the corrections given by the map. A mapping routine should be set-up in your mapping pass. Usually we do not map all dies, just selected ones. You could select in each row few dies. The mapping pass should have a name different then any other pass. It could be named **mapxx** or some other name (for example: **local**). Make sure you specify die x die is to be used and that you have the correct key offsets for the global and local alignment marks. The command you will use for **_Local Alignment (DFAS_ _)_ :** **MAP jobname\mapxx, passname**
Proceed as normal. Find a global alignment mark and do your best alignment. 
The first pass (mapxx) is the mapping pass. The system will do mapping, using dies that are selected in mapping pass. It will look for DFAS alignment mark in each die, and make corrections. When asked to make corrections, select yes. After corrections are applied, the exposure job will be performed shooting the pass named ""passname"". 
## **Running a FOCUS and\or EXPOSURE matrix**
The system is calibrated weekly on 4 inch Si wafers using resist SPR 955-0.9 and standard chuck (4”-500um). Your substrate type, thickness, and resist may require different focus and exposure setting than the standard calibration. A focus and\or exposure matrix should be done for each resist, to tweak your process relative to the calibration baseline. Once the process is optimized for a specific resist, the exposure time\focus will not change in future, since the lamp power is hold constant all the time. 
The focus and\or exposure can be **varied across** this array to determine the optimum focus relative to the baseline. **One focus step is equal to 0.1 um of focus depth. FOCUS OFFSET is an INTEGER!**
**+1=0.1um of lens movement up from the wafer**
**-1=0.1um of lens movement down toward the wafer**
  1. Before doing an EXPO job, LOG IN to [10,1] and type “MODE”
  2. Set the correct chuck size for the substrate
  3. LOG OUT form [10,1], and LOG IN to your account [10,xxx]
  4. Use the command **EXPO jobname\passname** and hit enter
  5. You can use one of your already defined jobs\passes with your highest resolution mask to optimize the process.
  6. Enter starting row within array specified in the pass (for example : 1)
  7. Enter ending row within the array specified in the pass (for example:6, depending how big is die size, and how many dies can fit in X direction)
  8. Enter starting column within array specified in the pass (for example:1)
  9. Enter ending column within the array specified in the pass(for example:6)
  10. Enter either **F=to vary the focus** , **E= to vary the exposure** , or **R for both** (to increment **focus** for each row **and** **exposure** for each column within the array)
  11. Enter the parameters as prompted by the computer. They will differ based on which option is chosen
  12. Press **RESET** on the small keyboard, and then the **MAN** and **S\C** simultaneously
  13. Wait a few seconds and press **MAN** again
  14. If you are doing an aligned test (like for exposure on top of a mesa) align the wafer now, press “EXPOSE”
  15. If you are NOT doing an aligned test, just press “EXPOSE”
  16. The command **EXPO** will shoot a specified serpentine array based on the parameters in your job\pass (first exposure - upper left corner)
  17. When exposure is finished, follow the recipe (post exposure bake if needed) with development. Please take your time for inspection, and select best exposure time and focus.
  18. The computer will ask you for the best row and column. Enter row and column number
  19. The computer will then tell you the focus and exposure based on the row and column you input
  20. **Do not update system focus !** Input a focus offset into your own exposure job. (If you update the system focus, you must change it back using the MODE command)
  21. Unload the mask plate, and LOG OUT.

## About
Our GCA wafer stepper is an i-line (365 nm) step and repeat exposure tool for doing lithography that requires high resolution (≥500nm) and/or critical alignment (≥150nm). 
The system has been modified to accept piece parts (down to smaller than 10mm x 10mm) up to 6” diameter wafers using manual wafer loading. The maximum square die size is 14.8 mm x 14.8 mm. 
The system has an Olympus 2145 (N.A. = 0.45) lens that reduces the mask image by 5x and gives an ultimate resolution of better than 0.5 um in the center of the lens field. The system can easily produce 0.7 um isolated lines across the entire field. The Autostep200 system has 3-point wafer leveling to improve focus uniformity across the field. Autofocus is used to determine the sample surface relative to the lens, making the focus stable and repeatable for different thickness of wafer. The stages are controlled by stepper motors and laser interferometers. 
Using the ""global"", manual alignment, better than 0.25 um alignment error is achievable. Using the DFAS ""local"" alignment system, alignment error better than 0.15 um is achieved. With the 1000 W Hg arc lamp, we get about 420 mW/cm² of i-line intensity at the wafer. 
The system is computer controlled with the capability to program and save a wide variety of exposure jobs. We also have unlimited phone support for system problems through a service contract.

## Two Alignments:
### 1) Wafer alignment to the system _/_ _Global (Manual Operation Only_)
The keyboard alone is used in this part of the exposure sequence to align the wafer to the system. The sequence of operations you do will depend on whether or not you used standard alignment keys or not. If you placed the sample close to the position you did during the first exposure, you should see an alignment mark in the right side of the screen. If not, you will need to find this mark using the position joystick by following a spiraling outward from the initial position. Pressing “F” repeatedly on the keyboard will do this spiral finding for you automatically. The red arrows on the number keys indicate the direction of movement for each keystroke. There are also + and -theta (angle) keys for rotation. Inc and Dec are used for microscope focus. The enter key on the numeric keypad changes from fast to slow movement. To change the joystick speed hit O on the main keyboard. Once the alignment mark is found follow one of the following procedures. Most of the time we use **Non-Standard Alignment keys** : 
**Standard Alignment Keys:**
  1. Adjust the focus (Inc and Dec keys) to get a crisp image (you might have to change speed with the Fast/Slow key).
  2. Align the right mark using the numeric keys labeled with arrows.
  3. Use the Theta keys to rotate the left image into position. Positive Theta = clockwise rotation of chuck. If you run out of theta alignment, you will need to adjust your sample on the chuck.
  4. The left image(left side of monitor) is used for theta only. The right image(right side of monitor) is used for x, and y alignment. Use the right image (right side of monitor) to do your best alignment. This step is important.
  5. Repeat process until satisfied with the alignment. You can obtain better than 0.2 um alignment consistently if you are careful.


**Non-Standard Alignment Keys:**
  1. Adjust the focus (Inc and Dec keys) to get a crisp image (you might have to change speed).
  2. Align the right mark using the numeric keys labeled with arrows.
  3. Press ""A"" on the main keyboard to toggle to the left alignment mark.
  4. Use the Theta keys to rotate the left image into position. [Positive Theta= CW, Negative Theta=CCW rotation of chuck]
  5. If you run out of theta alignment, you will need to adjust your sample on the chuck.
  6. The left image(left side of monitor) is used for theta only. The right image(right side of monitor) is used for x, and y alignment. Use the right image (right side of monitor) to do your best alignment. This step is important.
  7. Press ""A"" again to move to the right alignment mark
  8. Again adjust the right alignment mark
  9. Repeat process until satisfied with the alignment.
  10. Once alignment is finished, you have two option for pieces (quarters): BR orientation, and BL orientation.
  11. **BR orientation** - make sure you are on the right alignment mark before pressing ""EXP"", **BL orientation** - make sure you are on the left alignment mark before pressing ""EXP"". In both cases do your best alignment, but verify final alignment looking at the right image (right side of monitor).
  12. After global alignment, press EXP on small keyboard and the job will be executed.
  13. Remove the sample from the stage when done.
  14. Develop resist and inspect in microscope for alignment.
  15. Computer may ask for next wafer. To escape out of this press CTRL C followed by A and the enter key to abort out of the loop. If you have another wafer with the same job\pass, you can do it now without aborting.


### 2) **Wafer Alignment to mask _/_ _Local Alignment (DFAS)_** :
The best way to use this is to use a mapping routine followed by a shoot using the corrections given by the map. A mapping routine should be set-up in your mapping pass. Usually we do not map all dies, just selected ones. You could selected in each row few dies. The mapping pass should have a name different then any other pass. It could be named **mapxx** or some other name (for example: **local**). Make sure you specify **die x die** is to be used and that you have the correct key offsets for the global and local alignment marks. The command you will use is: 
  * **MAP jobname\mapxx, passname**


  1. Proceed as normal. Find a global alignment mark and do your best alignment. The first pass (mapxx) is the mapping pass. The system will do mapping, using dies that are selected in mapping pass. It will look for DFAS alignment mark in each die, and make corrections. When asked to make corrections, say yes. After corrections are applied, the exposure job will be performed shooting the pass named "" passname"". Follow instructions on screen when using this function.
  2. Remove the sample from the stage when done. (If Match was enabled, you will have to wait until the match is done again. It will do this before asking you for the next wafer). Develop resist and inspect in microscope for alignment (if needed)
  3. Computer will ask for next wafer. To escape out of this press CTRL C followed by A and the enter key to abort out of the loop. If you have another wafer with the same job\pass, you can do it now without aborting by placing it on the chuck and hitting MANUAL.

NOTE: DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN SCREWS!   
Please be careful tightening the screws when you use the shims with the stepper chucks. It is easy to over tighten the screws and strip out the chucks. Also, if you notice a screw head is being stripped, please discard the screw and use a new one.

#### _Exposing full wafers:_
##### First layer
Follow instructions for job programming. Create the job with passes needed for exposing different layers on the wafer. Select the proper chuck, attach the shim if needed. Load the chuck with a wafer on the stage. Type on the keyboard EX or EXEC Job name\Pass name1. Wait for the stage to stop moving. There is no need for aligning. The pattern will be centered to the center of wafer. This is your first layer. Microscope inspect after developing to make sure exposure looks good. 
##### Second layer
Select the proper chuck, attach the shim if needed, for your wafer. Load the chuck with a wafer on the stage. Edit your job and make sure information for the Job name\Pass name is correct. On the keyboard type command EX or EXEC Job name\Pass name2. Wait for the stage to stop moving. Start manual alignment. Find your right alignment mark on the right monitor, and align cross on the right objective to the right alignment mark. Press ""A"" and switch to the left objective. Align left objective to the left alignment mark. Repeat process until you are satisfied with alignment. You should see the same amount of the light between lines. Make sure your alignment looks good on the right objective. Press EXEC on the keyboard. Microscope inspect after developing to make sure second layer is aligned well to the first layer. 
#### _Exposing wafer pieces:_
Exposing wafer pieces is more complicated than wafer substrates. The main reason for this is that wafer pieces are usually small, they are not as flat as wafers are. Resist on a wafer piece is not coated as uniformly as it is on the wafer. The first challenge for wafer pieces is getting the first layer at the right place. This requires some skills regarding loading and aligning the wafer piece, as well as entering correct parameters in the job (key offset, pass shift). Document bellow explains exposing a first layer on the wafer piece if using a single centered mask plate.

## About
### General Capabilities/Overview
The ASML 5500 stepper is a 248nm (KrF) DUV stepper for imaging dense features down to below 200nm and isolated line structures down to below 150nm (with effort). 300nm+ features are relatively ""easy"" to resolve. Layer-to-layer overlay accuracy is better than 30nm. 
The system is configured for 4” wafers. The system is designed for high throughput, so shooting multiple 4"" wafers is extremely fast, typically minutes per wafer, but any size other than 4-inch is difficult to work with (see below for more info). Additionally, exposure jobs are highly programmable, allowing for very flexible exposures of multiple aligned patterns from multiple masks/reticles in a single session, allowing for process optimization of large vs. small features in a single lithography. 
The full field useable exposure area is limited to the intersection of a 31mm diameter circle and a rectangle of dimensions 22mm x 27mm. Users have stitched multiple photomasks together with success. See the [Mask Making Guidelines page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML_DUV\)#Mask_Design_and_CAD_files) for more info on exposure field sizes and how to order your mask plates. 
#### Stepper Tutorial
If you are not familiar with how Stepper Litho is different from our lithography methods, please review this short tutorial: 
[**Stepper Reticle Layout vs Wafer Layout (Demis D. John)**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf) - Explains the following: 
  * That a Stepper mask layout is very different than other litho systems.
  * That a Stepper mask can have _many_ designs, and flexibly pattern the wafer with combos of designs.


[**Stepper Reticle Layout (Advanced) - Complex Experiments and Variations**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Reticle_Layout_\(Advanced\)_-_Complex_Experiments_and_Variations ""Stepper Reticle Layout \(Advanced\) - Complex Experiments and Variations"")
  * If you need many design variations on your wafer, this is an efficient way to utilize stepper reticles.


### Photoresists Available
_See[PhotoLith. Recipes](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Lithography_Recipes#Photolithography_Recipes) for full process info & links to PR datasheets._
  * UV210-0.3 - Positive: 300nm nominal thickness
  * UV6-0.8 - Positive: 800nm nominal thickness
  * UV26-2.5 - Positive: 2.5um nominal thickness
  * UVN2300-0.5 - Negative: 500nm nominal thickness


  * DUV42P-6/DS-K101 - Bottom Anti-Reflective Coatings “BARC”
  * PMGI/LOL1000/LOL2000 - Underlayers


AZ300MIF Developer for all processes 
Many of these DUV PR's are also able to be exposed with [EBL](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/E-Beam_Lithography_System_\(JEOL_JBX-6300FS\) ""E-Beam Lithography System \(JEOL JBX-6300FS\)""). 
### Part Size Limits
With staff support, mounted pieces down to 14mm in size can be exposed using a 4” wafer as a carrier. Flatness will typically be worse in this situation, so small <<500nm features will usually have bad uniformity across the mounted part due to focus variations. Edge bead on irregular pieces (eg. quarter-wafers/squares) will significantly reduce yield/uniformity. 
Multi-layer Alignment on mounted parts is particularly difficult, requiring either semi-permanent mounting to the carrier (eg. BCB, SU8 etc.) or significant difficulty/effort to re-align the part to the carrier wafer on each lithography (≤100µm re-mounting accuracy needed). 
At this time the maximum wafer size is 4” (100mm) wafers with SEMI standard wafer flat (not Notch). 
### Service Provider
## Process Information
  * [**Process Recipes Page**](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Lithography_Recipes#Photolithography_Recipes) **> ""Stepper 3""** - _Established recipes and corresponding linewidths, photoresists etc._
  * Sample size: 100 mm wafers with SEMI std. major flat 
    * _Piece-parts process is possible but difficult - contact supervisor for info_
  * Alignment Accuracy: < 50 nm
  * Minimum Feature Size: ≤150 nm isolated lines, ≤200 nm dense patterns 
    * _To achieve ≤200nm features with high uniformity, we recommend wafers with total thickness variation (TTV) ≤5µm, and designing your CAD with a smaller Image Size for the high-res. feature_.
  * Wafer Thickness: Minimum ≈ 200µm, Maximum ≈ 1.1 mm
  * Maximum Dose: ~100mJ 
    * _Non-chemically amplified EBL resists are not permissible due to this limit._


### Maximum Wafer Bow
Measured over 90mm on the [Tencor Flexus](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Film_Stress_\(Tencor_Flexus\) ""Film Stress \(Tencor Flexus\)"")
  * **Do not run wafers with bow values higher than the following values** , contact supervisor for advice if needed.
  * Silicon wafers (~550µm thick): 100 µm will likely fail.
  * Sapphire (less pliable), ≥60µm bow will intermittently fail - DO NOT RUN 
    * This applies especially for GaN-on-Sapphire, which often have high wafer bow.
  * _Near these values, and you may lose the wafer inside the machine due to wafer vacuum error - DO NOT RUN if unsure._
  * _Substrate material and substrate thickness affect this limit - please contact[supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for advice._
  * You can **stress-compensate** wafers to reduce the wafer bow, eg. by depositing on the back side of the wafer. If your wafer is concave down, then depositing a _compressive_ film on the back will reduce its curvature. Coat the backside of the wafer with compressive PECVD SiO2 or [IBD SiN](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Sputtering_Recipes#Si3N4_deposition_.28IBD.29 ""Sputtering Recipes""), or other compressive films for concave-down bow.

### Part Size Limits
With staff support, mounted pieces down to 14mm in size can be exposed using a 4” wafer as a carrier. Flatness will typically be worse in this situation, so small <<500nm features will usually have bad uniformity across the mounted part due to focus variations. Edge bead on irregular pieces (eg. quarter-wafers/squares) will significantly reduce yield/uniformity. 
Multi-layer Alignment on mounted parts is particularly difficult, requiring either semi-permanent mounting to the carrier (eg. BCB, SU8 etc.) or significant difficulty/effort to re-align the part to the carrier wafer on each lithography (≤100µm re-mounting accuracy needed). 
At this time the maximum wafer size is 4” (100mm) wafers with SEMI standard wafer flat (not Notch).

  * Sample size: 100 mm wafers with SEMI std. major flat 
    * _Piece-parts process is possible but difficult - contact supervisor for info_
  * Alignment Accuracy: < 50 nm
  * Minimum Feature Size: ≤150 nm isolated lines, ≤200 nm dense patterns 
    * _To achieve ≤200nm features with high uniformity, we recommend wafers with total thickness variation (TTV) ≤5µm, and designing your CAD with a smaller Image Size for the high-res. feature_.
  * Wafer Thickness: Minimum ≈ 200µm, Maximum ≈ 1.1 mm
  * Maximum Dose: ~100mJ 
    * _Non-chemically amplified EBL resists are not permissible due to this limit._


### Maximum Wafer Bow
Measured over 90mm on the [Tencor Flexus](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Film_Stress_\(Tencor_Flexus\) ""Film Stress \(Tencor Flexus\)"")
  * **Do not run wafers with bow values higher than the following values** , contact supervisor for advice if needed.
  * Silicon wafers (~550µm thick): 100 µm will likely fail.
  * Sapphire (less pliable), ≥60µm bow will intermittently fail - DO NOT RUN 
    * This applies especially for GaN-on-Sapphire, which often have high wafer bow.
  * _Near these values, and you may lose the wafer inside the machine due to wafer vacuum error - DO NOT RUN if unsure._
  * _Substrate material and substrate thickness affect this limit - please contact[supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for advice._
  * You can **stress-compensate** wafers to reduce the wafer bow, eg. by depositing on the back side of the wafer. If your wafer is concave down, then depositing a _compressive_ film on the back will reduce its curvature. Coat the backside of the wafer with compressive PECVD SiO2 or [IBD SiN](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Sputtering_Recipes#Si3N4_deposition_.28IBD.29 ""Sputtering Recipes""), or other compressive films for concave-down bow.

## Generic Stepper Mask Parameters
### **Tutorial:**
If you are not familiar with the difference between designing Contact Litho Masks and Stepper Litho Masks/Reticles, please review this short tutorial: 
  * [Stepper Reticle Layout vs. Wafer Layout.pdf (Demis D. John)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)
  * [Advanced Stepper Reticle Layout - Complex Experiments/Variations](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Reticle_Layout_\(Advanced\)_-_Complex_Experiments_and_Variations ""Stepper Reticle Layout \(Advanced\) - Complex Experiments and Variations"")
    * _If you need many design variations on your wafer, this is a very efficient way to utilize stepper reticles._[![Schematic of stepper blocking off adjacent Images on reticle and exposure onto different wafer locations.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/0b/Stepper_Reticle_Tutorial_-_Reticle_Masking_Schematic.png/300px-Stepper_Reticle_Tutorial_-_Reticle_Masking_Schematic.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)**[Click for Tutorial](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)** Reticle Patterns (“images”) are independent of wafer-layout. The reticle could contain 20 variations while the wafer could have only a few of the Images actually exposed, in any desired location on the wafer, determined by the Job Programming.


### Required Parameters to Order
For the stepper you are designing for, make sure you know: 
  1. Magnification: 
    1. GCA I-Line steppers are 5x
    2. ASML DUV stepper is 4x reduction.
  2. Maximum exposure field size: 
    1. Your designs must fit within this area, including spacing between adjacent Image Fields.
    2. GCA AutoStep200 & GCA 6300 
      1. 14.8 x 14.8 mm at 1x wafer-scale (74mm square at 5x reticle-scale)
    3. ASML PAS5500/300 (DUV): 
      1. Intersection of a 22x27mm rectangle and an approx. 31mm circle: 
        1. [![KLayout screenshot of ASML mask design area](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/14/ASML_Mask_Design_Area.png/196px-ASML_Mask_Design_Area.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:ASML_Mask_Design_Area.png)ASML mask design area - intersection of 22x27mm rectangle and 31mm circle, a rectangle with the corners cutoff.
      2. A common design area is: 21x21mm or 22x22mm (closer to edges)
      3. 21x25mm, but 800µm on the corners will get cut off.
  3. Minimum gap between adjacent patterns/images that must be dark chrome (for the system's reticle shutters to block adjacent images) 
    1. GCA AutoStep 200: ≥1mm @ 1x wafer-scale (≥5mm @ 5x mask-scale) of chrome
    2. ASML PAS 5500/300 (DUV): ≥1mm of Chrome at 1x wafer-scale
  4. Minimum Feature size (chrome or glass) in your design, at _Reticle (magnified) Scale._ This is used to choose a quoted product number from our photomask vendor quotes; smaller features means more expensive mask plate (long write time). 
    1. For GCA's multiply your 1x wafer-scale feature size by 5x.
    2. For ASML PAS 5500/300, multiply your 1x wafer-scale feature size by 4x.
  5. Reticle size/thickness/material (already included on UCSB quotes for academic users) 
    1. For the GCA Steppers: 5x5x0.090 inches, soda-lime glass, 5x magnification/reduction 
      1. [See here for GCA mask details](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Autostep_200_Mask_Making_Guidance ""Autostep 200 Mask Making Guidance"")
    2. For the ASML PAS 5500/300: 6x6x0.250 inches, quartz, 4x magnification/reduction
    3. Academic users only: contact [Demis](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John"") for our mask plate quotes. Industrial users must contact photomask vendors themselves to get their own quotes. One of the following: 
      1. ""GCA AutoStep 200"" - this works for the GCA 6300 as well
      2. ""ASML PAS 5500/330"" - this is for the 248nm DUV Stepper.
  6. System model number - ask the photomask vendor to Magnify and Insert your 1x wafer-scale designs into the appropriate stepper template for the model of Stepper you are using. This will add system (mask-level) Alignment Marks & reticle barcodes on the outer edges. 
    1. ""GCA AutoStep 200"" - 5x magnification/reduction. Many users do the magnification & insertion into GCA template themselves, inserting your Cell Instance into [this CAD file](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/c4/GCA_Stepper_MaskPlate_Master-DarkField_5x.gds) (except it will be missing a Barcode).
    2. ""ASML PAS 5500/330"" - 4x magnification/reduction


These values will vary depending on the stepper you're designing for. Contact the Stepper's Process Expert or Tool Supervisor to find out/confirm the values on your mask order form. 
### Plots for Approval or Online Mask Viewer
Make sure the photomask vendor will show you a plot/image/schematic of the mask write _before_ they actually produce the mask plate. This is your chance to catch any errors before they start the expensive mask writing operation. 
**Do NOT approve the mask production until you are 100% sure everything looks ok!** Make sure all questions are answered, and ideally the Schematics look 100% correct before you approve the mask writing! If anything looks amiss, make sure you get updated schematics to confirm everything has been corrected. 
This a the way to avoid expensive mistakes! 
#### Flipped Mirroring
Some mask vendors return plots of your mask _Flipped in X_ , ie. ""right-reading Chrome Up"". This is because the mask writers write directly onto photoresist on the Chrome side of the plate, so this is plotting exactly what the mask-writer is going to write. 
#### Inverted Polarity
Some mask vendors return plots of your mask with White = Chrome & Dark = Clear glass, which can be counter-intuitive. (This is due to the mask writer's software, which _colors_ where the mask-writing will occur, which will _remove_ the Chrome in those regions). 
## Definitions for Mask/Reticle Order Form
When submitting the photo mask order, the following notes & definitions apply: 
  1. ""**Grade** "" or ""**Product Code** "" will be one of the items on our quote. This will specify the glass type (soda-lime or quartz), plate size (4"" square and 0.090"" thick, for example), and the pattern resolution. The grade choice determines the price, and is chosen based on required feature size (smaller feature size is more expensive). This is found on the vendor's quote, or you ask the vendor for a price based on desired minimum feature size (smallest feature actually present on your CAD file). 
    1. Although you will submit your CAD file at 1x wafer scale, the actual reticle is printer larger by the stepper's magnification (eg. 4x or 5x mag, depending on the stepper system), so make sure to choose your reticle grade accounting for this; eg. If my CAD has 1.0µm lines smallest feature, I should choose a photomask grade better/equal to 4.0µm for a stepper with 4x reduction.
    2. ""**Address Unit** "" - this is the ""pixel size"" or ""raster scan step"" for the mask write. The smaller the address unit, the longer the mask write time, so the higher the cost. Also the vendor may need to use a more expensive writer for smaller Address Units. Typically 50nm (cheap/coarse) down to 1nm (expensive/precise).
  2. “**GDS Level** ” is the “**layer number** ”.
  3. ""**topcell** "" or ""**structure name** "": which [_Cell_](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities#Cells_and_Instancing ""Calculators + Utilities"") in your CAD file contains the hierarchy of patterns to print.
  4. **Mirroring** should be ""**_Right-Reading_ (ie. legible text) when viewed with _Chrome Down_** "", if your CAD is exactly what you want on the wafer, for all our systems. 
    1. If you are doing backside alignment, make sure you Mirror your layers appropriately! We usually perform the mirroring ourselves in CAD and still submit the order with ""Right Reading/Chrome Down"", to avoid any confusion.
    2. IMPORTANT: Some mask vendors return plots of your mask _Flipped in X_ , ie. ""right-reading Chrome Up"".
  5. **Polarity** is usually ""_Polygons are Clear/Dark Field_ "", to ensure the regions between Images (patterns) and outer portions are all opaque Chrome. However, you can make your mask _Polygons are Dark/Clear Field_ , you just need to add polygons to put Chrome in between your adjacent Images. (FYI, ""_Digitized data_ "" is another way of saying ""_The polygons you drew_ "".) 
    1. Whether you are planning to use Positive or Negative photoresist makes a difference! Plan your process and the Mask Polarity accordingly.
    2. IMPORTANT: Some mask vendors return plots of your mask with White = Chrome, which can be counter-intuitive (due to the mask writer's software, which colors where the mask-writing will occur to remove the Chrome in those regions).
  6. “**Min. Feature on Mask** ” refers to minimum clear or opaque feature, assuming features similar to _lines/spaces_. This should be at the reticle-scale since that is what the Photomask company will be making & fabricating for you - see ""Grade"" above.
  7. “**Min. Contact** ” refers to features with aspect ratio close to 1:1, eg. Squares and circles (such as ""contact pads""). These have a separate spec (often worse) due to the mask manufacturing process, so make sure to choose the appropriate grade of photomask with this in mind.
  8. “**CD** ”, or ""**Critical Dimension** "" - Choose a CD similar to your most critical feature (scaled to the 5x/4x reticle scale), so the photomask vendor will print & measure & guarantee test structures at that exact size. They'll usually write a small CD pattern somewhere on the edge of the plate, and will guarantee that CD size. Should not be smaller than the Min. Feature size chosen, or they'll require you to choose a more expensive grade to achieve that smaller size..
  9. ""**Registration** "" - we usually choose ""Not needed"" for our plates. This refers to whether the patterns needs to be accurately aligned to the glass plate itself - which is not a problem for Stepper masks since the system aligns to the written Chrome patterns only.


## CAD Tips
  * Design with (0,0) the origin at the _Center_ of your mask plate, and/or wafer-center. 
    * See here for [enabling the Origin (0,0) marker on KLayout](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/KLayout_Design_Tips#Turn_on_the_display_of_the_Origin_\(0,0\) ""KLayout Design Tips"").
  * By default, Wafer flat is Down (–Y) with respect to your CAD file for most systems.
  * Utilize the ""Cell"" and ""Cell Instancing"" functionality in your CAD layout program! (aka. a ""Block"" in AutoCAD). Highly recommended to use KLayout, not AutoCAD. See [Calculators + Utilities > CAD Design Tips](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities#CAD_Design_Tips ""Calculators + Utilities"") for tutorials.
  * Center your entire design around the coordinates (0,0). (0,0) should always be the center of your device, wafer and/or photomask/reticle Cells. Photomask vendors should then NOT ""auto center"" your designs on the plate. 
    * Inside each sub-Cell, also design around the cell's (0,0) origin.
  * Create a Cell called ""_reticle_layout_ "" or similar, that is an exact representation of what the printed reticle patterns should look like (typically at 1x wafer-scale, if _not_ including the outer templates for the stepper system). Instance the Device's Cells into _reticle_layout_ , and reference this Cell on your mask order form. (You can also Instance the same cells into ""_device_layout_ "" and ""_wafer_layout_ "" cells during design/verification.).
  * You don't have to include the Stepper outer template - usually photomask vendors can add the reticle-level alignment marks, barcodes etc.; you just send them your 1x wafer-level designs, and instruct the vendor to magnify by 5x/4x, insert into a template for the specified stepper (tell them the model), and they can do the rest. 
    * For our GCA systems, which we have the full reticle template files for, you can optionally do the 5x magnification and insert into the template file yourself if desired.


  * If you follow the above rules, your printed ""_reticle_layout_ "" Cell will have Instances of each of your design's Images/patterns, and the coordinates/sizes of these Cells are exactly what you use to write your Stepper program. 
    * You can then fill out the Image Coordinates onto a programming cheat-sheet, such as this one for the ASML: [UCSB_Stepper_-_Programming_Worksheet.pptx](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/5/56/UCSB_ASML_DUV_Stepper_-_Programming_Worksheet.pptx)
  * If you are doing many design variations, you should utilize the Stepper's mix-and-match capabilities, [**as described in these tutorials**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tutorials#Stepper_Mask_Tutorials:~:text=verniers%2C%20fonts%20etc\)-,Stepper%20Mask%20Tutorials). This allows more design variations on a single plate, saving valuable (expensive) mask plate area/cost.

Stepper Recipes,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_Recipes,"Back to [Lithography Recipes](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lithography_Recipes ""Lithography Recipes"").
Below is a listing of stepper lithography recipes. Stepper 1 and Stepper 2 are i-line systems with good piece handling capabilities. Stepper 3 is a DUV (248nm) system primarily used for full 100mm wafers. DUV resists do not work for i-line and i-line resists do not work for DUV. Based on your sample reflectivity, absorption (or whether or not you use an ARC layer), and surface topography, the exposure time / focus offset parameters may vary. 
This listing is a guideline to get you started. For critical lithography steps, you should run your own exposure and/or focus array to determine the proper parameters. 
The recipes are tabulated to give you the values of the key parameters you will need to establish your recipe. Underlayers such as LOL2000 or PMGI can be used on the stepper systems. See the underlayer datasheets for details. Post develop bakes (not listed) are used to make the resist more etch resistant and depend on subsequent processes. Care should be taken with post development bakes as resist reflow can occur. Unless otherwise noted, all exposures are done on flat, silicon wafers. 
Parameters are indicated in separate tables for each stepper system.

Multiply the GCA 6300 exposure times by 0.30 to get a starting exposure time for the GCA Autostep200 system. 
## Positive Resist (GCA 6300)
Unless otherwise noted, bakes are on hot plates. For recipes with CEM, the CEM is spun on after the first resist bake, exposure is then done, and the CEM is rinsed off with DI water before the PEB. CEM generally improves resolution and process tolerance at the expense of higher exposure time.

## Negative Resist (GCA 6300)
Unless otherwise noted, bakes are on hot plate. All flood exposures are done in broadband light using any contact aligner. Also, because the tone is negative, a shorter first exposure time will result in more undercut, which is desirable for single-layer lift-off processes. Under these conditions more develop time will also give more undercut.

## Process Control Data
  * _The Process Group regularly measures data on lithography Critical Dimension (""CD"") and Wafer-stage Particulate Contamination for this tool, using a sensitive lithography process that will reveal small changes in Dose repeatability and wafer flatness._

### Particle Checks
Our cal process enables both ~300nm critical dimension logging, and also allows us to see when a particle is present on the exposure chuck (a ""hot spot""). 
[![Image showing 2 wafers with colorful rainbow patterns, both show a black spot on the right side.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/b/b0/ASML_Cal_Particle_Check.png/300px-ASML_Cal_Particle_Check.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:ASML_Cal_Particle_Check.png)Both wafers show a ""hot spot"" on the left side, so the tool has a particle at that location, requiring physical cleaning.

## General Litho + Recipe Info
### Photomasks & Job Programming
You can find info on making photomasks, CAD files for alignment marks, and other Job programming tools on the main Tool page, here: 
[Stepper 3 (ASML DUV) > Design Tools](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML_DUV\)#Design_Tools ""Stepper 3 \(ASML DUV\)"")
### ASML Focus movement
A positive focus offset moves the wafer stage upwards. 
### Feature Size vs. Dose
The ASML tends to give fine control over feature size via variations in Exposure Dose (mJ/cm2). One such process is plotted here:

John](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""))
### BARC (Anti-Reflection Coating) Etching
The DUV42P BARC layer, which is best suited for resolving small features, needs to be O2 etched after develop. 
Counter-intuitively, this does _not_ lead to your total resist thickness being thinner, as explained in 
""BARC"" and ""ARC"" etches have been written and made available on all our primary etchers. 
Here are links to the recipes for each etcher: [ICP#1](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=ICP_Etching_Recipes#Photoresist_and_ARC_Etching_.28Panasonic_1.29), [ICP#2](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=ICP_Etching_Recipes#Photoresist_and_ARC_etching_.28Panasonic_2.29), [RIE#5](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=RIE_Etching_Recipes#Photoresist_and_ARC_.28RIE_5.29), [FL-ICP](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/ICP_Etching_Recipes#Photoresist_.26_ARC_.28Fluorine_ICP_Etcher.29) & [Technics PEii ashers](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Ashers_\(Technics_PEII\) ""Ashers \(Technics PEII\)""). 
## Anti-Reflective Coatings
Bottom Anti-reflective coatings (aka. BARC or AR Coating) are, in general, used for the ASML stepper. LOL2000 and PMGI can also be used as under layers. BARC layers will increase the process tolerance, especially for features ≤ wavelength (248nm). 
For example, without BARC you might find that 200nm features only resolve with focus of -0.2µm to -0.3µm, while with BARC the process tolerance may increase to -0.1µm to -0.4µm, which also increases tolerance to wafer flatness/PR spin uniformity.

### Reticle Layout
[![Schematic of stepper blocking off adjacent Images on reticle and exposure onto different wafer locations.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/0b/Stepper_Reticle_Tutorial_-_Reticle_Masking_Schematic.png/645px-Stepper_Reticle_Tutorial_-_Reticle_Masking_Schematic.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)**[Click for Tutorial](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/c/cb/Demis_D_John_-_Stepper_Reticle_Layout_vs_Wafer_Layout.pdf)** Reticle Patterns (“images”) are independent of wafer-layout. The reticle could contain 20 variations while the wafer could have only a few of the Images actually exposed, in any desired location on the wafer, as determined by the Job Programming. ([Demis D. John](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""))
  * Setup your reticle with separate _**Images**_ , each Image corresponding to a design variation. 
    * In the example below, my mask plate has the following design variations:
    * Electrode Width: 2 variations (1mm wide, 500µm wide)
    * Mesa Width: 3 variations (500µm, 750µm, 1000µm)
    * Interdigitated Electrodes with Line/Space variations (250nm and 350nm)
    * A single Pad Layer design, that works for any device variation.


Since these Images are setup with enough opaque Chrome between them that the Stepper can block off and select a single Image for exposure, **we can program the stepper to mix & match any design variation across my wafer**. 
Reticle with design variations   
---  
Example reticle with rows of different design variations. Note the spacing between each Image should be opaque chrome, and wide enough for the stepper shutters/blades - see the parameters on each stepper's Mask Making Guidelines page.  [![screenshot of reticle layout](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/21/Stepper_Reticle_Layout_Tutorial_-_Reticle_layout_with_variations.png/550px-Stepper_Reticle_Layout_Tutorial_-_Reticle_layout_with_variations.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Stepper_Reticle_Layout_Tutorial_-_Reticle_layout_with_variations.png)  
### Stepper Job Programming
The KLayout simulated wafer layout below would actually have to be _programmed_ in the Stepper's exposure Job, as follows: 
  * The Top 1/3 of the Wafer gets: 
    * Layer 1 = IDE **250nm** line/space
    * Layer 2 = Mesa **2000µm**
    * Layer 3 = Electrodes = **750µm**
    * Layer 4 = Standard Pads Image.
  * The Middle 1/3 of the Wafer gets: 
    * Layer 1 = IDE **350nm** line/space
    * Layer 2 = Mesa **1000µm**
    * Layer 3 = Electrodes = **500µm**
    * Layer 4 = Standard Pads Image.
  * The Bottom 1/3 of the Wafer gets: 
    * Layer 1 = IDE **350nm** line/space
    * Layer 2 = Mesa **2000µm**
    * Layer 3 = Electrodes = **750µm**
    * Layer 4 = Standard Pads Image.

This would actually need to be programmed on the Stepper, this KLayout schematic is just a ""simulation"". [![Screenshot of Wafer Layout with variations](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/6/6a/Stepper_Reticle_Layout_Tutorial_-_Wafer_layout_with_variations.png/567px-Stepper_Reticle_Layout_Tutorial_-_Wafer_layout_with_variations.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Stepper_Reticle_Layout_Tutorial_-_Wafer_layout_with_variations.png)  
### Exposures during processing
When you actually run the wafers, each Lithography will automatically pattern the variations you have setup; you will do your lithography as follows: 
  * **Layer 1 (IDE)** will expose: 
    * Top 1/3 of the Wafer: IDE **250nm** line/space
    * Middle 1/3 of the Wafer: IDE **350nm** line/space
    * Bottom 1/3 of the Wafer: IDE **350nm** line/space


Then you perform your liftoff or etch etc. Then you perform the next litho as follows: 
  * **Layer 2 (Mesa)** will expose: 
    * Top 1/3 of the Wafer: Mesa **2000µm**
    * Middle 1/3 of the Wafer: Mesa **1000µm**
    * Bottom 1/3 of the Wafer: Mesa **2000µm**


You perform your Mesa etch, and then run Layer 3 exposure which does the following: 
  * **Layer 3 (Electrodes)** will expose: 
    * Top 1/3 of the Wafer: Electrodes = 750µm
    * Middle 1/3 of the Wafer: Electrodes = 500µm
    * Bottom 1/3 of the Wafer: Electrodes = 750µm


And the final **Layer ""pads""** will expose the same Pads Image on every die, then you can perform a single develop & evaporation & liftoff to complete all the devices.

# About
Our Strip annealer is primarily used for ohmic contact formation on III-V compound semiconductors. The system runs in a forming gas environment to keep oxygen contamination minimized. Temperature of the graphite strip is electronically controlled to prevent overshoot and the phase changes of the metal can be observed through the stereo microscope while annealing is taking place. This observation is often the best way to get the best ohmic contact. Thermal interlocks prevent the system from overheating and maximum anneal times are on the order of several minutes. Anneals up to 500°C are permitted. The graphite strip is only 1.5 inches wide, limiting the sample size. 
# Detailed Specifications
  * Temperatures up to 500°C for several minutes
  * Forming gas ambient
  * Sample size limited to 1.5 inches on a side
  * Electronic temperature control
  * Maximum sample size ~ 1.5 inches square
  * Stereo microscope for viewing the contact phase change

## About
This system uses a laser-based scattering method to count size and distribution of particles (or other scattering defects) on a flat wafer surface. 
It can scan wafers in size from 4 to 8 inches. Piece-parts are more difficult but can be scanned with a custom recipe. 
4-inch wafers are the most standard size to measure. 
For measuring very low particle counts accurately, purchase ""low particle count"" (LPC) wafers from a Silicon wafer vendor, and keep the wafers in the case and clean at all times until use.

## About
We have two high-performance mask aligners for contact exposure processes. They are manual mechanical systems alignment, contact/proximity, with exposure shuttered by a timer. The resolution (depending on contact mode, optics and exposure wavelength and ""operator technique"") is into the submicron region. (See descriptions for our ""Std."" and ""IR"" units). 
Our units are configured for the near-UV window (365 and 405 nm). All units have the ""vacuum contact"" option extending resolution to ~0.7 microns. Higher resolution optic systems that can be supplied by Suss are given below. The standard soft and hard contact modes of mechanical and pneumatic pressure respectively, give resolution to ~1 micron. 
Exposures can be done on substrates from small ""piece parts"" of less than 1 cm square to substrates of 3 inch diameter or square. Masks up to 4 inches in size can be used although only 3” x 3” of this area is usable. A 4” wafer can be exposed with the system. However, only 3” x 3” will be exposed on the wafer and vacuum mode is unavailable. 
#### Backside Alignment
On the Standard MJB-3, special black chucks may be used for optically transparent materials, allowing you to view through the wafer. 
For backside alignment through opaque materials such as Si or GaAs, our IR aligner has backside infrared illumination (halogen bulb) through these black chucks. A Hammamatsu IR camera is installed to view the infrared image. 
Using a filter, the IR system can be configured for I-line (350 nm) only, assisting in resolution. 
## Detailed Specifications
  * Wafer size: 3"" max. for vacuum mode; 4” for soft contact (3” x 3” exposure area)
  * Substrate size: 3"" x 3"" max.
  * Wafer / substrate thickness: 0-4.5 mm
  * Mask plate size: 4"" x 4"" x 0.090"", typically soda-lime glass. Smaller (eg. 3"") is also acceptable.
  * Exposure optics: 
    * Standard unit (Aligner #1): 350-450 nm/200 W mercury lamp
    * IR unit: 280-450 nm/200 W mercury lamp (can filter to 350 nm)
  * Additional manufacturer options (none installed on our systems): 
    * DUV (polychromatic): 240-260 nm/350 W Cd-Xe lamp; 0.2 micron resolution (PMMA)
    * DUV (monochromatic): 248 nm/KrF excimer laser; 0.3 micron resolution (PMMA)
    * 193 nm/ArF excimer laser; 0.2 micron resolution (PMMA)
  * Uniformity: 
    * ±3% over 2"" diameter
    * ±5% over 3"" diameter

# About
The Flexus instrument is used to measure the stress introduced onto a wafer after thin-film deposition by measuring local curvature of a wafer. The system uses a scanning laser detector configuration to measure the surface position of a wafer across its diameter. With automatic rotational control, a 3-D map can also be obtained. By comparing before and after measurements of the sample, the local stress of the sample can be calculated from the local curvature. The stage can also be heated up to 500°C to measure thermal mismatch of the thin films with the substrate. 
# Equipment Specifications
  * Measurement range is 2E7 to 4E7 dyne/cm2
  * Stress can also be measured as a function of time or temperature. The system has a temperature range from room temperature to 500°C.
  * Measurement results are organized in an easy to read spreadsheet format that can easily be exported to other data handling software such as Excel.
  * Windows 3.xx control and file storing
  * 3-D mapping
  * Laser/Detector Scanning Configuration
  * Substrates must be round and films must be reflective.
  * Fixtures are available for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6"" wafers. 8"" wafers can be ran as well without a fixture.

# About
This system is the primary thermal evaporator (tungsten strip or wire resistance heater source boats) in the cleanroom. It complements and augments offered by the Sharon e-beam system in that p-type contacts for III-V compounds such as Zn may only be done here, but it allows for easier access and depositions without the risk of radiation damage for many of the same materials as the e-beam. The system has been upgraded over the years from its original diffusion pump design to now include a cryopump and custom-built electronics for turn-key pumpdown and venting operations. Typically source materials are melted in ""dimpled"" flat tungsten boats. These include: Al, Ag, Au, Au/Ge, Au/Pd, Au/Zn, Cr, Mn, Ni, SiO and Zn. Cr is evaporated (sublimed) from a pre-coated rod and SiO from a special baffle heater, both available from R.D Mathis Co. Evaporation rates are manually controlled by varying the output voltage of a variac which feed various transformer taps (and feedthroughs) allowing for currents up to 200 amps. Although the unit heater boat selector can theoretically accommodate up to four units, present fixturing only allows for three, which are heated sequentially. Rates are monitored with a standard 6 mHz crystal oscillator. Samples typically are piece parts or quarters of 2 inch wafers, and are clipped onto a removable metal plate which sits at approximate 12 inches from the sources. At present 2 inch wafers would be the maximum sample size for 100% coverage. The substrate rotation fixture from the Sharon system can also be used. Substrate heating is possible with user supplied heater assemblies. Deposition cycling time from pumpdown to deposition to system venting is two hours, the same as the e-beam systems.

# About
This system is the primary thermal evaporator (tungsten strip or wire resistance heater source boats) in the cleanroom. It complements and augments offered by the Sharon e-beam system in that p-type contacts for III-V compounds such as Zn may only be done here, but it allows for easier access and depositions without the risk of radiation damage for many of the same materials as the e-beam. The system has been upgraded over the years from its original diffusion pump design to now include a cryopump and custom-built electronics for turn-key pumpdown and venting operations. Typically source materials are melted in ""dimpled"" flat tungsten boats. These include: Al, Ag, Au, Au/Ge, Au/Pd, Au/Zn, Cr, Mn, Ni, SiO and Zn. Cr is evaporated (sublimed) from a pre-coated rod and SiO from a special baffle heater, both available from R.D Mathis Co. Evaporation rates are manually controlled by varying the output voltage of a variac which feed various transformer taps (and feedthroughs) allowing for currents up to 200 amps. Although the unit heater boat selector can theoretically accommodate up to four units, present fixturing only allows for three, which are heated sequentially. Rates are monitored with a standard 6 mHz crystal oscillator. Samples typically are piece parts or quarters of 2 inch wafers, and are clipped onto a removable metal plate which sits at approximate 12 inches from the sources. At present 2 inch wafers would be the maximum sample size for 100% coverage. The substrate rotation fixture from the Sharon system can also be used. Substrate heating is possible with user supplied heater assemblies. Deposition cycling time from pumpdown to deposition to system venting is two hours, the same as the e-beam systems.

## [Tystar 8300](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tube_Furnace_\(Tystar_8300\) ""Tube Furnace \(Tystar 8300\)"")
### Available Recipes (Tystar 8300)
The following are the available recipes on each furnace tube: 
**Tube 1: Various applications**
  * SOG425.001 - _Spin-On Glass Cure_
  * ALGAAS.001 - _Oxidation of AlGaAs_
  * ANNEAL.001 - _Anneal with variable time and temp._


**Tube 2: Cleaned Silicon Only**
  * WET1050.002 - _WetOx at 1050°C_
  * DRY1050.002 - _DryOx at 1050°C_
  * WETVAR.002 - _WetOx, variable temp._
  * DRYVAR.002 - _DryOx, variable temp._


**Tube 3: Processed silicon or other anneals.**
  * WET1050.003 - _WetOx at 1050°C_
  * DRY1050.003 - _DryOx at 1050°C_
  * WETVAR.003 - _WetOx, variable temp._
  * DRYVAR.003 - _DryOx, variable temp._
  * ANNEAL.003 - _Anneal with variable time and temperature_


Data: Tube3, Recipe ""WetVar.003"" at 750C, TOX rate= 0.228nm/min, n@632.8nm= 1.47067, BHF etch rate=79nm/min 
### Process Limits (Tystar 8300)
  * **Max temperatures (Tystar 8300)**
    * Tube 1: 800°C max.
    * Tube 2: 1100°C, for ≤24hr
    * Tube 3: 1100°C, for ≤24hr
  * **DRY1050** may not be run for more than 3hrs. O2 flow is 3SLPM, which is too high to run for more than 3hr without depleting the bottle. 
    * Contact supervisor for other options, such as _**DRYVAR**_ @ 1100°C, or with lower O2 flow.
  * **WET1050** may not be run for more than 24hrs without authorization, due to O2 bottle capacity. Contact supervisor if need to run longer.
  * No recipe should be run with >1slpm gas flow without discussing with supervisor first, or gas bottles will be depleted very fast and likely run out during your process.


### Wafer Cleaning
For Tube #2, Silicon wafer cleaning, the following process is recommended: 
  1. If brand new wafers, they should be already relatively clean. Otherwise Acetone/ISO clean might be needed to remove particles - optional
  2. Use [Bay 4 toxic corrosive bench](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wet_Benches#Wafer_Toxic_Corrosive_Benches ""Wet Benches"") to submerge wafers for 20min in PureStrip @ 60°C. Replenish if needed, since PureStrip degrades after a few days at 60°C.
  3. QDR - rinse.
  4. Transport to Bay 5 HF bench (keep in water - optional) - use Chemical Transport Container.
  5. Submerge in HF for 10min.
  6. Rinse in DI 3x at HF bench. Pure HF goes down special drain, while rinse water can go down normal drain.
  7. Dry with Nitrogen gun OR SRD ""Spin Rinse Dryer"" at Bay 5.
  8. Ready to load into Tystar quartz boats, run recipe on Tystar.


### Oxidation Recipes (Tystar 8300)
#### Calculating Oxidation Times
Online calculators for thermal oxidation can be used to estimate the oxidation time for a desired oxidation thickness. Please see the [Calculators + Utilities](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Calculators_%2B_Utilities ""Calculators + Utilities"") page for links to these oxidation calculators. 
Using the _Partial Pressure_ yourself if you need higher accuracy. 
A simpler but less accurate oxidation calculator can be found at the

## Wafer Substrate Bonding
### Direct Bonding
Numerous research groups perform direct wafer bonding (of various materials) using either the [Suss Wafer Bonder](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wafer_Bonder_\(SUSS_SB6-8E\) ""Wafer Bonder \(SUSS SB6-8E\)""), or a custom graphite fixture in conjunction with any one of [numerous ovens](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Thermal_Processing ""Thermal Processing""), such as the N2-purged [Wafer Bonding Furnace](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tube_Furnace_Wafer_Bonding_\(Thermco\) ""Tube Furnace Wafer Bonding \(Thermco\)"") (with glove box) or N2-purged [Blue M oven](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/High_Temp_Oven_\(Blue_M\) ""High Temp Oven \(Blue M\)"") or HeraTherm oven. 
Il addition, the [Fine-Tech Flip-Chip Bonder](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Flip-Chip_Bonder_\(Finetech\) ""Flip-Chip Bonder \(Finetech\)"") can perform aligned bonding of various-sized pieces. The Fine-Tech can do metal-to-metal thermo-compression bonding with ultrasonic assist.

# About
Tom has a varied background of job experiences. He began in 1978 working in the construction industry installing asphalt and concrete. He has worked in the oil fields as a wireline operator maintaining gas lift wells. He is also a journeyman plumber. 
He graduated from UCSB with a BS in Electrical Engineering in 1990. After graduation, he continued in a staff position at UCSB working in Professor John Bowers’ group. He helped start Terabit Technology with John Bowers and Aaron Hawkins in 1996 which was purchased by Ciena Corporation in 1998. At Ciena he was a Senior Engineer working on optical packaging, III/V semiconductor processing, and facility design and construction. The primary goal at the Goleta Ciena division was to build optical receivers using a novel fused APD developed at UCSB. 
In 2002, the Goleta Ciena division was sold to new investors and became VTR Corporation. He became the Operations Manager and continued producing optical receivers and began development on optical transceivers using VCSEL sources. 
He returned part time to UCSB in 2005 as a Senior Development Engineer to finish the new facilities and install all the process equipment into the current Engineering Science Building Nanofab. 
In 2006 he began working part-time for Transphorm as a Facility Manager. Transphorm is a start-up company that produces GaN devices for high voltage power conversion applications. He was responsible for design/construction of all facility labs, cleanrooms, offices and equipment necessary for operation. 
In 2012 he became the full time Lab Manager of the UCSB Nanofab facility. In 2018 he transitioned from Lab Manager to his current position as an Engineering Expert as he phases into retirement. 
Co-author on over 30 technical papers, and one patent based on optical packaging. 
# Current Work
Tom is currently transitioning to retirement. He continues to offer assistance in the operations of the lab while working on new process equipment selection and installs. He is working on several lab projects at this time.

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

### **What to do in case of computer (monitor) freeze-up.**
Reboot – When terminal keyboard ( main keyboard- add photo) locks up, etc. 
1. If the terminal keyboard (main keyboard) is not responding, first make sure the **NO SCRL** key was not pressed on the keyboard (add photo). This gives the appearance that the keyboard is locked up but the screen has just been paused. 
2. On the terminal keyboard (main keyboard) press type **Ctrl** + **]** (Press **Ctrl** first then **]** ) 
This exits the terminal and returns control to the MOP PC(#1).- add photo 
3. Pullout the PC keyboard (upper keyboard, add photo) and press button **Scroll Lock** twice. This toggles the KVM switch from the Smart Set PC (#2) to the MOP PC (#1). 
4. Using the mouse (next to upper keyboard) , select ALT + X to exit (bottom off the screen). You can also type ALT + X on the keyboard. A window will open (on the top monitor, add photo) asking to power down the Stepper, click OK. The PC will exit to DOS. 
5. At this point you can either restart the software from DOS or turn the MOP PC (#1) off and on (add photo). To restart from DOS, enter **stepper** at the DOS prompt. 
6. The main menu for the MOP PC (#1) should appear on the top monitor once the software/PC boots up. Pullout the PC keyboard (upper keyboard) and using the mouse, select **Operate Stepper** -> **Start**. Put the keyboard away. 
7. At the prompt on the lower monitor, using the main keyboard, enter **the time and date as specified** (10:25 19-NOV-02). Press Enter ( the return key) 
8. LOG IN [10,1], type ORIG . The stage will find its origin and then go back to the load position 
9. LOG OUT. 
### **What to do if the local alignment or wafer exposure mapping hangs up on the upper monitor.**
1) Reset lower Advent computer (#2)- add photo and wait for reboot. 
### **What to do in case of unplanned power outage**.
1) CR Staff will take care of the system in the morning. 
### Errors job related
**What to do for alignment error.**
1) Verify that **correct alignment key offset** is being used 
2) Verify that **the mask** is aligned 
3) Verify that the baseline is correct (check values in MODE against the last calibration in the calibration notebook) 
4) If you have DFAS alignment marks, perform a MAP job to verify alignment. 
**What to do for focus resolution problems**. 
1) Verify **system focus** using the MODE command 
2) Perform a focus optimization job (using command **EXPO** **job name**). Use F- to vary focus, enter exposure time. You need to enter the increment step. Use one of your jobs that is already written. Use the same type of wafer that you will be using for your real job (substrate type, and thickness). If you need to optimize both (exposure time and focus), you will use the same command **EXPO** **_job nam_ e**, and will enter starting exposure time, and focus, and increment step for both. 
3) Verify that your wafer is not bowed (i.e. under stress from some process) 
**What to do in case of mask vacuum problem**. 
1) Check that small pump is running in back of system. Make sure vacuum level is above 20” Hg. 
2) Push foot down onto mask with hand so that the vacuum holds the mask. 
**What to do in case of focus getting stuck and system hanging up**. 
1) Adjust manual focus knob so that a negative number appears on voltmeter ( add photo). 
2) Note die on computer screen that was exposed. Abort using Ctrl-C followed by A. Edit the program and drop out the problem die. If you have exposed some die already, you may want to drop them out too for the second run. 
**What to do in case of the stage limit going too far** (red stage limit light will be lit inside the stepper chamber next to the joystick. 
1) Press the lit limit switch to release the stage. 
**Reporting the error/issue**
Who to call if you cannot undo the problem or need some help with Stepper 
1) Biljana Stamenic ( if it is related to the job or stepper use) 
2) Lee Sawyer (if there is the issue with the tool, something not working/broken) 
2) Mike Silva (if neither Lee or Biljana can be reached) 
3) NOTE: Leave a note that stepper is down. E-mail nanofab@ece.ucsb.edu to report a problem.

## About
The three stack Tystar 8” furnace is used primarily for 3 processes. The processes are dedicated for specific tubes as follows: 
  * **Tube #1** : SOG curing & low-temp oxidation
  * **Tubes #2 and #3** : Dry or wet oxidation of silicon (unprocessed, clean)
  * **Tube #3** : General furnace annealing & oxidation, including processed material


Each process tube can accomodate up to one hundred 8” wafers per cycle. We have boats for 2"", 3"", 4"", 6"", 8"" and irregular shaped pieces. The maximum temperature is 1100°C for the system. Gases used are O2, Steam from DI-H2O, N2. 
## Process Information
Recipe Characterization Data, such as thermal oxidation times, can be found on the recipe page: 
  * [Thermal Processing Recipes: Tystar 8300](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Thermal_Processing_Recipes ""Thermal Processing Recipes"")


Use the _Partial Pressure_ on the calculator to match your experimental data. 
Keep in mind that all process must be 30 minutes in length at a minimum. Processes less than 30 minutes will suffer from poor uniformity because the process tube will not have sufficient time to saturate with O2 or DI-H2O. 
### Gases Available
  * N2 (15/5 slpm)
  * O2 High-range ""O2HI"" - 15 slpm
  * O2 Low-range ""O2LO"" - 1 slpm
  * All gasses flow through the H2O bubbler, which can optionally be filled with heated water to flow steam, or evacuated (no steam, gas only).


## Recipes
  * **Tube 1** - low temperature tube. Applications: Wafer Bonding, Curing Spin-on-glass/dielectrics, AlGaAs oxidation, annealing.
  * **Tube 2** - _CLEAN_ Silicon only, Wet and Dry oxidations only.
  * **Tube 3** - Wet/Dry Oxidation, Annealing

Tutorial - How Photomasks are Made,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tutorial_-_How_Photomasks_are_Made,"If you don't know how photomasks are made, it is easy to make a mistake in your order or tell the photomask vendor something that confuses them but makes sense to you. Glass photomasks are made using the _same_ fabrication processes as your wafer lithography, except with direct-write lithography. 
There are essentially 2 sections to the mask plate fab: **(1)** The data preparation and **(2)** the mask production. 
## Contents

  * [2 Data Preparation](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tutorial_-_How_Photomasks_are_Made#Data_Preparation)
  * [3 Transparency Masks](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tutorial_-_How_Photomasks_are_Made#Transparency_Masks)
  * [4 Afterword](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tutorial_-_How_Photomasks_are_Made#Afterword)


### Mask Production
  1. Vendors _buy_ a glass plate, that is purchased pre-coated with Chrome and Photoresist. 
    1. The glass plate, called a ""mask blank"", is the ""substrate"" that they will process on.
    2. The size and thickness and type of glass specifies which ""mask blank"" they choose to start with.
    3. Soda Lime is the cheapest glass, and is recommended for more lithos. Quartz is more expensive, but is more transparent to UV, so is required for DUV exposures.
    4. Photomasks mostly use positive photoresist.[![fabublox cross section screenshot.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/55/Tutorial_-_Photomask_-_Substrate.png/300px-Tutorial_-_Photomask_-_Substrate.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Tutorial_-_Photomask_-_Substrate.png)The ""Mask blank"" that photomask vendors start with.
  2. The photomask is loaded into the mask writer with **Chrome + Photoresist _Side Up_** in order for the mask writer to write on the photoresist directly. 
    1. Mask writers are tools very similar to the [Heidelberg MLA150](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Maskless_Aligner_\(Heidelberg_MLA150\) ""Maskless Aligner \(Heidelberg MLA150\)"") or EBL tools.
    2. Most photomasks are _used_ in the fab with _Chrome Down_. Don't confuse these two!
    3. To avoid confusion, photomask vendors will use the terms 
      1. **""Right Reading Chrome Down""** (RRCD), which means _TEXT_ you inserted into tour CAD should be legible/readable (""right reading"") when the chrome is Down, for example on a table. 
        1. This is how most NanoFab users would define their CAD - their CAD is of their actual desired wafer, which is when the Mask Plate's Chrome is _Down_ , so any text should be readable with Chrome Down.
      2. **""Wrong reading chrome down""** means that _TEXT_ in your CAD file would be mirrored when the chrome is down. Some users might need that!
    4. Since the mask is written _Chrome Side**Up**_ but most NanoFab users want their patterns to be correct with _Chrome Side**Down**_ (the mask is flipped over in the mask writer compared to how it'll be used in the fab), the vendors usually have to Enable the ""Mirror"" option on their mask writer's software.[![fabublox cross-section of direct-writing on mask](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/0/01/Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_direct-write.png/131px-Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_direct-write.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_direct-write.png)Direct-write onto mask blank, with Photoresist and Chrome UP.
    5. The mask writing software usually shows you _**Black** **or filled shapes**_ wherever the laser will be _**On**_ , meaning the positive photoresist gets removed and Cr exposed in those regions. 
      1. Some Dataprep teams are kind enough to (a) mirror and (b) invert the software screenshots, so you can see what a _Fab user_ cares about - chrome down + dark=Chrome (opaque), but neither of these are what the photomask vendor cares about!
    6. This is a very _long_ write, because the laser writehead raster-scans (zig zags) like a regular ink printer, except with 0.10µm grid size (a home printer is ~50µm spot size - 500x larger) - so it takes _hours_ for a mask plate to get written! Since time is money (eg. companies are paying staff by the hour), the longer the write, the more expensive the mask plate.
  3. Develop - just like wafer lithography. The Chrome is now exposed wherever the photoresist is removed. [![fabublox cross section](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/d4/Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_Develop.png/134px-Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_Develop.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_Develop.png)
  4. Etch the Chrome & Strip the Resist. Wet chemical etch is common, but many vendors also have dry etch for tight specs. Std. solvent or O2 plasma for PR strip. [![fabublox cross section of Cr etch and PR strip](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/2b/Tutorial_-_photomasks_-_Cr_etch_and_PR_strip.png/355px-Tutorial_-_photomasks_-_Cr_etch_and_PR_strip.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Tutorial_-_photomasks_-_Cr_etch_and_PR_strip.png)
  5. Metrology - measure/confirm whether the requested resolution and defect levels were met. 
    1. The Data Prep team will have either added their own in-line measurement patterns to your mask, on the edge of the mask plate (preferred), or you will have told them which exact feature they should measure to confirm that they met the Critical Dimension (CD) you requested.
    2. Automated measurement of defects, or general microscope inspection, to ensure they are below the quoted spec.
  6. If CD was not met, or defects too high, then they will have to re-run the mask fab - which is expensive for the vendor! 
    1. So if you request an unusually tight spec, they will charge you more to cover the cost of any potential remakes they sometimes might need to do.


### Data Preparation
Users often send their CAD files in varying states of disarray. The data needs to be wrangled so the production team doesn't get confused or perform a bad write - which is an expensive mistake! 
  * The patterns might be at some random coordinate, or centered around (0,0), or with the (0,0) in the bottom-left corner of their design. That coordinate may or may not have anything to do with the mask plate size! 
    * We recommend you always put (0,0) in the center of your desired mask plate!
  * The patterns may be on some random GDS layer, or there may be many layers. Which one do they write? 
    * We recommend you always export a version of the CAD file with ONLY the layers to be written.. All constructions and non-write layers removed.
  * The user-provided patterns are usually only the wafer pattern, but might need other patterns added, such as: 
    * Outer templates for specific stepper machines, including alignment marks for the stepper's mask alignment
    * Barcodes for automatic readers (also in found Steppers),
    * Human-readable ""Titles"" printed onto the plate (outside the wafer exposure areas)
    * Metrology test-patterns - for automated measurement of Critical Dimension, for example - also placed outside the wafer exposure area on the edge of the plate.[![klayout screenshot of photomask regions](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/e/e5/Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_GCA_example_template_%28incorrect%2C_guessed_coords%29_v1.png/488px-Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_GCA_example_template_%28incorrect%2C_guessed_coords%29_v1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Tutorial_-_Photomasks_-_GCA_example_template_\(incorrect,_guessed_coords\)_v1.png)Example of patterns added by photomask vendors - in this case a fictitious stepper mask (these regions are *not* correct, just an example).
  * For steppers, user-provided patterns may need to be magnified (scaled-up) from 1x wafer-scale to the 5x or 4x reticle-scale, and inserted into the stepper template.
  * You can specify multiple layers for multiple individual plates (for example, a full ""set"" of contact mask plates, one for each process step/Layer) - where each layer will be a unique photomask plate. The data prep team needs to export each layer into their own photomask writer job.


### Transparency Masks
Very cheap contact litho masks can be made using high-DPI printers, by printing onto 
If you print the transparency yourself: 
  * You may need to boost your printer's contrast or ""density"" or ""quality"" to get the black as dark as possible. Remember these settings as use the same settings every time.
  * The side of the transparency you print onto makes a difference. We usually print onto the glossy/smooth side.


Other tips: 
  * The side of the transparency you expose your wafer with matters! We usually put the ink-side against the wafer.
  * Because the transparency plastic absorbs UV, you will usually need a higher exposure dose on the contact aligner than with a glass mask plate.
  * You really can't clean a plastic transparency with acetone, iso or O2 plasma, since it will dmaage the ink/plastic. Soap and water at most. This is a major drawback to transparencies - they're only good for a handful of exposures, whereas glass plates can be easily be cleaned and reused hundreds of times. If you're only shooting a handful of devices, this may be acceptable for the cost savings.


### Afterword
You can see that the needs of the photomask vendor's production team are different, and often conflict, with the needs of a NanoFab user! Keeping this in mind, you can often avoid a _lot_ of confusion, or even expensive photomask mistakes, by making the photomask vendor's job as easy and clear-cut as possible. 
They don't want _options_ (""do this or that, whichever you prefer""), they'd much rather get exact instructions. So make up your mind, or discuss the options with [NanoFab Processing staff](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu//wiki/Staff_List#Process_Group) _before_ you submit you mask, and don't change anything mid-flow, especially not via email! 
And _Never_ ""approve"" the plots they send you for approval if you see something you don't understand! Once you ""approve"" it, they'll start the expensive write; so make sure it's 100% correct before you say ""_looks good_ ""!.

UCSB NanoFab Microscope Training,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/UCSB_NanoFab_Microscope_Training,"## Overview
We have numerous optical microscopes in our lab, each of which is a different model or manufacturer. 
However, almost all of these microscopes share common features, even if the knob to enable the feature is in a different location. This ""training"" is intended to give the user an overview of these features, which are very useful for general observations, measurements, inspections after etching/other processing steps, distinguishing residues vs. delamination, to name a few. 
```
**DO NOT TURN MICROSCOPE OBJECTIVES BY HAND** for motorized microscopes!
Most of our scopes have motorized objective turrets, use the electronic buttons instead.

## Focus
### General Focusing
**The main danger on a microscope is crashing the objective into your sample!**
ALWAYS begin at low magnification where the distance between the sample and objective is largest. Then gradually work your way up in magnification. 
The focus knobs on all of our microscopes turn _**towards the user**_ to _**increase**_ separation between the sample stage and microscope objectives. Thus, when focusing on a sample, **always start by turning the knob in this ""safe"" direction to prevent crashing the sample into an objective**. If the image gets blurrier, then turn the knob the other way, and confirm that the sample is becoming less blurry. 
There is usually a Coarse knob - the outer part of the knob, and a Fine knob - the inner part of the knob. **Be very careful when turning the Coarse knob** , and watch the distance between the sample stage & objective while turning to prevent crashing! 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/40/Microscope_Training_-_focus_on_edge_crop_-_.jpg/150px-Microscope_Training_-_focus_on_edge_crop_-_.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscope_Training_-_focus_on_edge_crop_-_.jpg)Focusing on the edge of your sample.
A useful trick before focusing is to do the following: 
  1. Observe the microscope illumination spot on the stage (looking directly at the sample/stage, not through the eyepieces)
  2. Center the illumination spot on the edge of the sample, so there is a large height difference between the sample edge and the stage.
  3. Then, while looking through the eyepieces, turn the _**Coarse**_ knob towards you and observe whether the Edge of the sample becomes more or less blurry. (You can also look at the sample/stage directly to make sure nothing is going to crash.) You should be able to see the hard edge of the sample even when it is very blurry, and focus on the top-surface using this edge.
  4. Then drive towards the feature on the sample surface you need to image, and the focus should be pretty close (_**Fine**_ -focus only).


### Depth Measurements using focus
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/a/af/Nikon_OptiPhot_200_-_6219_-_focus_knob_-_.jpg/200px-Nikon_OptiPhot_200_-_6219_-_focus_knob_-_.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Nikon_OptiPhot_200_-_6219_-_focus_knob_-_.jpg)Focus Knob with Micron gradations
Many microscopes have gradations marked on the fine-focus knob, indicating microns of movement of the sample stage. Using these marks, one can focus on different surfaces and use the gradations to estimate how many microns of vertical separation is present between the two surfaces. Measurement Error stems from your your ability to tell whether a surface is in-focus, often 5-10µm for 5x mag, and more accurate for higher magnifications. 
If the microscope has motorized focus, the control software may display the focus height, which can then be used to measure the depth between different focus heights. 
### Focusing on a sample with no features (Focus Stop)
If your sample has no features or dust to focus on, you can still make sure you are focused on the sample surface using an adjustable aperture that projects a shadow on the sample, called a “Focus Stop” (sometimes marked as F.S.). When the edge of this shadow is sharp, the surface is in focus. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/4/4a/Nikon_OptiPhot_200_-_6224_-_field_iris.jpg/150px-Nikon_OptiPhot_200_-_6224_-_field_iris.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Nikon_OptiPhot_200_-_6224_-_field_iris.jpg)Knob to adjust size of Iris projecting shadow onto the sample. “F.S.” for “focus stop”. |  [![Microscope Image of the focus stop shadow on a sample.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/5/5c/Microscope_Training_-_UScope_F-stop_example_annotated_1000px.png/200px-Microscope_Training_-_UScope_F-stop_example_annotated_1000px.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscope_Training_-_UScope_F-stop_example_annotated_1000px.png)Shadow projected on the sample by Focus Stop iris. When the shadow is sharp, you are focused on the sample surface.

## Microscope Objectives
### Preventing a Crash
Changing objectives is the easiest way to crash into a sample, especially with motorized objective turrets. A few tips can easily prevent this from happening. 
ALWAYS begin at low magnification where the working distance between the sample and objective is largest and the depth of focus is also largest. 
The microscope objectives on all our microscopes are designed such that the sample is still approximately in focus when an objective is changed. Thus, one should **only change objectives when there is some feature that is _in focus_ on the sample**. If you don't see anything at all, either because there are no features or because the sample is out of focus, **find something to focus on before changing objectives**! The “focus stop” iris (above), pieces of dirt or dust are particularly useful for this purpose, and the wafer edges often have such dirt from tweezers etc. The Field Iris / Focus Stop / Shadow for focusing mentioned above would also help. 
### Working Distance
Working Distance or WD of an objective is the distance (usually in millimeters) from the objective lens to the sample, for the sample to be in focus. 
Generally, the lower the magnification, the longer the working distance. 
For example, a 5x objective may have a long working distance (distance to sample) of 10mm, while the 100x may be very close at 0.2mm. 
Thus it is very important that **initial focus is found with a low magnification** (and corresponding long working distance). Also the focal depth (range over which sample stays in focus) is wider for low mag, making it much easier to find the focal height, so you should always switch to the lowest mag. before starting to image your sample. (And switch back to lowest mag. when done, out of courtesy for the next user.) 
Some objectives may actually have ""WD"" printed on them. For example, ""**WD 1.0** "" means that the sample will be in focus when it is approx. **1.0mm** away from the objective. This is very helpful when estimating, by eye, whether you need to move the sample stage up or down to get into focus. If the objective says ""WD 0.2"" that means it has to be so close that you really should just start at low mag. and work your way up, keeping the sample in focus at each successive magnification! 
## Digital Imaging & Measurements
Many of our microscopes have cameras and software for image capture. 
For our scopes that have AmScope cameras and software installed, please see the following tutorial for making/saving measurements: 
  * [**Measurements and Imaging with Amscope Camera - Quickstart Usage Guide**](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Measurements_and_Imaging_with_Amscope_Camera_-_Quickstart_Usage_Guide ""Measurements and Imaging with Amscope Camera - Quickstart Usage Guide"")


### Measurements outside the lab
If you know the _microscope and objective_ used for acquiring a photo, you can make calibrated measurements on the photos at your own desktop using the following software: 
  * AmScope Software - free microscope image analysis software, installed on many of our scopes. 
    * [Measurements and Imaging with Amscope Camera - Quickstart Usage Guide](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Measurements_and_Imaging_with_Amscope_Camera_-_Quickstart_Usage_Guide ""Measurements and Imaging with Amscope Camera - Quickstart Usage Guide"")
    * AmScope Calibration File containing calibrations for all NanoFab microscopes: [Download Here](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/wiki/Images/uploads/2020/AmScopeCalsAll.magn)
    * Also available on _**Nanofiles-SFTP / Manuals / Amscope**_
  * FIJI - scientific image analysis software - for stand-alone image analysis after acquiring images. 
    * [The Microscope Measurement Tools plugin](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/FIJI_-_Microscope_Measurement_Tools ""FIJI - Microscope Measurement Tools"") has pre-configured calibrations for NanoFab microscopes & SEMs, and allows you to draw length measurements. 
      * _Calibrations in this plugin repository are out of date as of microscope upgrades in 2019_.
    * There are many other useful plugins, for particle counting, creating animations etc.


## Imaging Modes & Optical Filters
Numerous imaging modes can be enabled or enhanced via optical filters available on the scopes. 
The filters have a 
Do not pull the filters past the detent, or they may block the light path, and please **don't remove them fully from the microscope**. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/da/Microscopes_-_Filter_Out_position-detent.png/300px-Microscopes_-_Filter_Out_position-detent.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscopes_-_Filter_Out_position-detent.png)Microscope filters in the ""out"" position.
### ""Yellow"" Filter for Photoresist
#### Uses
  * Prevent exposing photoresist


The Yellow/Green filters block Blue and UV light. 
These filters will be labelled with: 
  * ""GIF"" (green light only) or
  * ""Y"" (yellow)


Neither of the above filters will expose I-line, DUV or EBL photoresists. Light hitting the stage should look yellow or green when inserted. 
### Adjusting Brightness
#### Aperture
The adjustable Aperture can be used (on Scope #3/#4) to vary the illumination brightness: 
[![Photo of the A.S. Aperture Stop open/close buttons on Microscope #4](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/e/e6/Microscope_Training_-_Aperture_Stop_Buttons.jpg/237px-Microscope_Training_-_Aperture_Stop_Buttons.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscope_Training_-_Aperture_Stop_Buttons.jpg)""_A.S.: Aperture Stop_ "" open/close buttons on Microscope #4
#### ND Filters - ""Neutral Density""
  * These filters reduce illumination/brightness.


These filters just reduce the incoming brightness, like wearing sunglasses. They do so without altering the color of the light. 
You can insert more ND filters to further dim the input light. 
_ND16_ is dimmer than _ND8_ - put both in for even dimmer illumination. 
### DIC/Nomarksi Imaging
[![microscope photos of Birght-Field and DIC of photoresist residues](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/d/d5/Microscope_DIC-Nomarski_Example_v1.jpg/247px-Microscope_DIC-Nomarski_Example_v1.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscope_DIC-Nomarski_Example_v1.jpg)Comparison of Bright-Field versus DIC imaging of photoresist residues left after a lift-off. _[Demis D. John](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""), 2019._
#### Uses
  * Highlighting particles
  * Observing topography/height differences.
  * Converts nanometer-level topography/height differences into color.


Many of our scopes have DIC imaging capabilities, although the filters that need to be inserted are arranged differently on each. 
#### DIC Filters Needed
To enable DIC imaging, your scope needs 
1) Input light to be polarized (often adjustable) 
2) A prism inserted above the microscope objective 
3) Output light (towards the observer) to be polarized, with adjustable rotation 
The user should **rotate the polarization** to obtain the best image (eg. with highest contrast). 
**_NOTE_** : The DIC prism creates a slight double-image when inserted - make sure to pull it **out** to it's detent for normal imaging! 
#### DIC on Microscopes 3/4
For Microscope #3, all three of these filters may be inserted/removed as indicated: 
[![Image/schematic of the 3 DIC filters on Microscope 2](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/3/3e/Microscopes_-_DIC_filters_and_light_path.png/410px-Microscopes_-_DIC_filters_and_light_path.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Microscopes_-_DIC_filters_and_light_path.png)The 3 filters needed for DIC imaging (Microscope 3). Other Microscopes also have these 3 filters, but located in different positions or sometimes combined.
#### DIC on FL-Scope
On the Fluoroscope, the rotatable filter wheel sets both the input & output polarizers simultaneously when you set it to ""_DIC_ "", but you still need to insert/remove the DIC Prism. 
#### DIC on µScope-2
The DIC prisms are located directly on the microscope objectives, and are not intended to be manually inserted/removed. We have left the DIC prisms only on the lower-mag objectives, and removed them from the 100x/150x objectives (where DIC imaging doesn't really work that well), in order to provide better high-mag imaging. 
You still have to insert/remove the two polarizers. 
The Input polarizer has motorized rotation, controlled by the controller pendant. 
### Dark Field Imaging
[![microscope image showing bright dots indicating particles](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/8/8a/Dark_Field_Microscopy_-_High_Particle_Count_example_2025-03-25_W1_particle_check_Demis.jpg/205px-Dark_Field_Microscopy_-_High_Particle_Count_example_2025-03-25_W1_particle_check_Demis.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Dark_Field_Microscopy_-_High_Particle_Count_example_2025-03-25_W1_particle_check_Demis.jpg)Example of a High particle count wafer on Microscope #4, at 5x magnification.

John](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""), 2025).
#### Uses
  * Observing particles on flat surfaces
  * Observing edges of features
  * Estimating particle count vs. size


#### Enabling Dark Field

Dark Field can be enabled by pulling the BF/DF slider to the ""DF"" position. ""BF"" puts it back into standard ""Bright Field"" mode.

[![schematic showing light path for a smooth surface vs. particle, thro microscope objective](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/21/Dark_Field_Microscopy_explanation_v1.jpg/242px-Dark_Field_Microscopy_explanation_v1.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Dark_Field_Microscopy_explanation_v1.jpg)Schematic explaining Dark Field microscopy mechanism _[Demis D. John](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Demis_D._John ""Demis D. John""), 2025_
The default microscope mode is Bright-Field imaging, where flat reflective surfaces on your sample are ""bright"" (illuminated). Incoming light hitting a flat surface is reflected straight back through the microscope objective, to reach the eyepieces/camera. 
Dark Field imaging instead sends light through the sides of the microscope objective, so incoming light hits the sample at an angle. Light that hits a flat surface thus misses the optical path back to the eyepieces/camera, appearing ""dark"". Only light that hits curved/non-flat surfaces will be scattered back up through the microscope objectives, producing a bright spot. 
#### Tips for particle estimations using Dark Field
The brightness of the illumination has a huge effect on how many particles will be observed. For example, in DF mode a dim microscope will show fewer particles than a brightly-illuminated microscope. If you are using Dark Field to clean samples or reduce particles on the surface, I recommend the following practices 
  * Use the same microscope each time - different microscopes have different illumination intensities.
  * Raise the illumination brightness to maximum (just to provide a consistent brightness)
  * Open the Illumination Aperture to maximum, with this button: [![Photo of the A.S.

  * Remove all ND filters, and/or take note of which are inserted. Use these for reducing the brightness if desired.

## Common problems
When accessing access-restricted Google pages, here are common issues & solutions: 
### Wrong Google account
If you see a field like this: 
[![screenshot of google ""request access"" page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/6/6c/UCSB_NetID_wrong_google_account_access_denied_v1.png/274px-UCSB_NetID_wrong_google_account_access_denied_v1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:UCSB_NetID_wrong_google_account_access_denied_v1.png)
  * The circled region above shows that you are NOT logged in with your UCSB NetID Google account (which should show an address like **_YourNetID_ @ucsb.edu**).
  * You are erroneously using a Personal Google account.


To switch accounts, 
  * Click the circled google login button
  * Choose ""**Use Another Account** "", or click the ""**_YourNetID_ @ucsb.edu**"" login if available. 
    * Login with _MyNetID@ucsb.edu_ as your username, and your chosen password.


After this the requested page should work - retry the link or reload the page. 
Make sure the top-right of the page shows the correct UCSB Login, not your personal login: 
[![Screenshot of Top-right of google pages showing the UCSB Logo.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/1/1e/UCSB_NetID_-_correct_google_account_v1.png/330px-UCSB_NetID_-_correct_google_account_v1.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:UCSB_NetID_-_correct_google_account_v1.png)Top-right of google pages should show the UCSB Logo if you are logged in with your UCSB NetID.
You can click the above button to switch between active Google logins. 
#### ASML Documentation - request access
For the [ASML Documentation](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML_DUV\)#Operating_Procedures ""Stepper 3 \(ASML DUV\)""), the tool supervisor still must grant access to your _NetID@ucsb.edu_ account (a requirement by the tool vendor). 
  * Email the [ASML tool supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML_DUV\) ""Stepper 3 \(ASML DUV\)"") to request access.
  * Make sure to _include your UCSB NetID_ in the request. We can only grant access to Authorized NanoFab users with a valid UCSB NetID, by vendor request.


### Google always changes login when viewing the page
Due to a Google bug, sometimes switching google logins doesn't load the original Google Drive page making it impossible to do so with the correct Google login. 
To remedy this, you need to: 
  * Log Out of all Google Accounts, 
    * Click the Icon of your currently logged-in Google account on the top-right
    * Choose ""**Sign out of all accounts** ""
  * Log In with _only_ the desired Google Account (eg. with your UCSB NetID).


If logging out of other accounts presents a major inconvenience, then you can instead use a separate Web Browser app to do this. 
For example if you usually use Google Chrome and are experiencing this problem 
  * download 
  * _only_ login with your UCSB NetID on that browser app (no other Google accounts), and
  * then access the desired page.

You will not break the lamps if your sample is too thick and the stage is not adjusted correctly but you will not be able to close the sample drawer.
  2. Press and release the #1 button on the controller.
  3. Enter the length of time the system is to ""exhaust"" after the UV turns off and press the ""E"" button.
  4. Press and release the #2 button on the controller.
  5. Enter the ""Total time"" for the process and press the ""E"" button (i.e. If the value for #1 is set to 5 minutes and the value for #2 is set to 7 minutes the system will run the UV for 2 minutes and exhaust for 5 minutes). The value for #2 must be greater than the value for #1.
  6. If you make a mistake and #1 is greater than #2 the UV will not shut off. In this case just cycle the power switch on the front panel.

## About
UV+O (atomic oxygen) cleaning method is a photosensitized oxidation process in which the contaminant molecules of photo-resists, resins, human skin oils, cleaning solvent residues, silicone oils, and flux are excited and/or dissociated by the absorption of short-wavelength UV radiation. Near atomically clean surfaces can be achieved in less than one minute. In addition, this process does not damage any sensitive device structures of MOS gate oxide. The system can be used for oxygen activation, etching or oxidation of a surface without ion bombardment.

## About
This system is configured as an ICP etching tool with 1000 W ICP power, 600 W RF substrate power, and 30C - 200°C operation with back-side He to maintain controlled surface temperatures during etching. This chamber has Cl2, BCl3, Ar, N2, and O2 for gas sources and can be used to etch a variety of materials from compound semiconductors to metals. The high temperature etching is specifically useful for etching of high Indium containing compound semiconductors such as InP, where etch product volatility is an issue. High aspect ratio, smooth vertical wall, InP and related compound semiconductor (InGaAs, InAlAs, InGaAsP, etc.) etching is done in this system. The chamber is configured for 4"" wafers. Pieces are handled by using a silicone-based thermal heat sink compound. Both sapphire and silicon carrier wafers are available. Laser end-point monitoring is also included in the system. 
### Cluster Configuration
A Deposition and Etch chamber are both attached to the same loadlock, allowing etching and deposition without breaking vacuum. Each chamber can be scheduled separately on SignupMonkey.

# About
This system is configured as an ICP PECVD deposition tool with 1000 W ICP power, 600 W RF substrate power, and 100°C-350°C operation. This chamber has 100% SiD4, N2, O2, and Ar for gas sources. The high density PECVD produces a more dense, higher quality SiO2 and Si3N4, as compared with conventional PECVD. With the high density plasma, deposition of high quality films can be deposited as low as 100°C for processes requiring lower temperatures. Stress compensation for silicon nitride is characterized. Processes are available for Gap-filling with SiO2. 
### Cluster Configuration
A Deposition and Etch chamber are both attached to the same loadlock, allowing etching and deposition without breaking vacuum. Each chamber can be scheduled separately on SignupMonkey.

```
The Deposition chamber currently has **Deuterated Silane (SiD4)** installed - identical to the normal Silicon precursor SiH4, except that it significantly lowers optical absorption in the near-infrared. This gas is **expensive** and thus more applicable to optical applications than to general-purpose SiN films.

### Important Notes
  * Maximum 0.5µm of deposition prior to chamber cleaning, in order to maintain low particle counts.
  * See the [**ICP-PECVD Unaxis Recipes** page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/PECVD_Recipes#ICP-PECVD_.28Unaxis_VLR.29 ""PECVD Recipes"") for thin-film properties of each of the following recipes.
  * We highly recommend using the [Surfscan particle counter](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Surface_Analysis_\(KLA/Tencor_Surfscan\) ""Surface Analysis \(KLA/Tencor Surfscan\)"") to monitor particle counts on look-ahead wafers prior to deposition. 
    * You must measure particle count on wafers **before** and **after** the deposition. We usually run ""SiO2 HDR-Std"" recipe. See the procedures on the [Surfscan page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Surface_Analysis_\(KLA/Tencor_Surfscan\) ""Surface Analysis \(KLA/Tencor Surfscan\)"").
    * If you note abnormally high particle counts for G4 (>200): 
      * Run chamber clean
      * Chamber season on a clean test wafer
      * Retest Particle counts 
        * If particle counts are still high, notify the [tool supervisor](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/ICP-PECVD_\(Unaxis_VLR\) ""ICP-PECVD \(Unaxis VLR\)"").
  * For new recipes (as of Dec. 2019), users may **only edit _Deposition Time_** , no other recipe modifications or customizations are permitted without staff approval.

Usage Data and Statistics,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Usage_Data_and_Statistics,"### Numbers of Annual Users
The UCSB Nanofabrication Facility has seen large user base growth extending from 1998 to the present. A decrease was seen from 2013-2015 which was primarily a result of reduced academic government funding stemming from sequestration. Since 2015, growth in both academic and industrial sectors has been observed with 2019 reaching the highest levels to date. Covid-19 deeply affected the 2020 use, but has since rebounded. The facility serves a broad range of disciplines with Optics, Electronics, Materials, MEMs, and Physics all being over 12% of use. 2018 data is shown as an example and this remains a consistent representation.

# About
The applications of this tool are mainly in MEMS-device fabrication areas (releasing a MEMS structure by etching a sacrificial SiO2 layer below) with the use of Al2O3, Al or some other metal as an etch mask at 45oC. The tool uses vapor HF (VHF), EtOH (Ethanol vapor is an Alcohol-based one, ionizing the HF and activating etching, influencing within wafer etch uniformity, and being most compatible with VHF), and N2 gases and can process small sample(s) (on a 8"" Si carrier wafer) up to an 8"" wafer. There are 5 standard etch recipes installed in the tool with the SiO2 undercut-etch-rate from low to high. The SiO2 undercut-etch-rate is from ~10nm/min to ~350nm/min.

# About
The applications of this tool are mainly in MEMS-device fabrication areas (releasing a MEMS structure by etching a sacrificial layer below), in which Si or Ge or even some metals, such as Mo, can be isotropically dry etched using gaseous XeF2 (no plasma enhancement or heating is needed) with the use of photoresist or SiO2 or Al as an etch mask at room temperature. For users who want to etch through or very deep into a Si wafer, they should use the Si Deep RIE tool in the lab. The XeF2 etch process is a purely chemical one and usually results in a rough etched surface. The tool is operated in a pulsed mode in which the etch chamber is repeatedly filled with XeF2 gas and, then, pumped out (to 0.3 Torr). You can also add N2 gas, together with XeF2 gas, into the etch chamber for some applications. There is a microscope attached to this tool, with which you can monitor the etch process of your sample. You can change the number of etch cycles during a run, which will be effective in that run. Also, you can manually stop a run based on microscope observations.

Video Training - Introduction (Internal),https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Video_Training_-_Introduction_(Internal),"There are many ways to generate a training video. 
The general methods we are currently using are as follows: 
  * Record the video nearly the same as an in-person training 
    * Use a GoPro on a headmount, to show hands-on wafer-handling etc.
    * Use software like 
    * Use our Sony Handycam on Tripod to record computer screens on computers you can't install Windows software on.
    * It is useful to record in segments, breaking the video/recording up between topics. This makes updating the video much easier later on (if procedures change), allows you to re-record just one section, and allows you to add bookmarks for users to skip to the relevant sections when watching. 
      * It can be helpful to make a quick list of topics/segments before you start.
  * Edit your video together using 
  * Videos will be hosted on [GauchoCast-Panopto](http://gauchocast.ucsb.edu/). Upload the single video file to PanOpto. 
    * The NanoFab has a shared PanOpto folder - request access from Demis/Mike/Aidan if needed.
    * Move your completed video to the ""_Training Videos - Published_ "" folder
    * Get the link to that video, and post that link on the Tool's wiki page. See the [ASML Stepper #3](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Stepper_3_\(ASML_DUV\) ""Stepper 3 \(ASML DUV\)"") page for an example.
  * Hosting trainings: Different tools may require different methods. Choose appropriately. Remember the point is to reduce staff training burden. 
    * For many tools, we are able to tell users to watch the training video independently and contact the supervisor when they are ready for hands-on training. Supervisor then runs a *short* hands-on just to verify user is competent, and answer any questions. Can do hands-on for multiple users at a time. This method is working well for lithography tools, where we generally wait for users to contact us for training (we don't widely advertise trainings, different from many other tools).

  * Require Lab Users/Attendees use a desktop/laptop computer to join, not just phone. They will need to see details on the screen and possibly take notes.
  * Ensure you are connecting from a high-speed internet connection, eg. on-campus and wired (not Wifi). You will be streaming video to attendees, so this is important!. 
    * The Video Training Workstation in the conference room is set up for this, with web cam.
  * Require all attendees to have video ON during the entire training. 
    * This verifies that all participants are present and paying attention - local school/college teachers found this was necessary!
  * Use the Zoom > Participants > ""**Mute All** "" button 
    * Let users know they can unmute themselves whenever needed, to ask questions. Just pause the video when someone asks.

  * In your regular web browser, load the pre-recorded video: 
    * The video should be posted on the Tool's wiki page. Just click the link to launch the video.
    * If not, you can also find the videos on the **Browse** option on the left to find it in the **NanoFab** folder.
  * Maximize the window size, and play/pause as needed. 
    * If users find the screen share to be too blurry to read, try to make the video larger: 
      * Minimize the bottom-bar showing the video clips
      * Full-screen the video, eliminating the side-video (where appropriate).
  * You can use the [→ ←] button to switch which video is larger, or the [_] button to maximize only one video feed.
  * If appropriate, schedule short hands-on followup trainings for the fragile or sensitive parts of the process (eg. Wafer load/unload etc.).

## About
This tool is most often used for bonding samples to Silicon carrier wafers with CrystalBond wax. 
This mounting method can be used for 
  * securing smaller parts for use on 100mm tools (such as the [CMP](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Chemical-Mechanical_Polisher_\(Logitech\) ""Chemical-Mechanical Polisher \(Logitech\)""))
  * providing a carrier wafer for through-etching of Silicon wafers on the [Bosch Etcher](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/DSEIII_\(PlasmaTherm/Deep_Silicon_Etcher\) ""DSEIII \(PlasmaTherm/Deep Silicon Etcher\)"")
  * for [dicing](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Dicing_Saw_\(ADT\) ""Dicing Saw \(ADT\)"")
  * for [lithography](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Lithography ""Lithography"")


A user can place the two wafers to be bonded in contact, with the adhesive in between (such as wax, photoresist etc.). A rubber membrane is lowered on top, creating a small vacuum chamber. The tool can then be programmed to heat the wafers and melt the wax/cure the adhesive, while vacuum is pulled in the chamber, which pulls the rubber membrane down onto the top wafer. This flattens the bond and evacuates bubbles from between the wafers, providing a planar bond. 
We also have recipes for spin-coating the crystalbond wax, allowing for a uniform coating of the adhesive wax.

## About
The Flip-Scribe is a manual scribe+break cleaving system, with a diamond tip that scribes along the underside of the part/wafer. The user manually drags the part across the diamond scribe, using the guides and stops to push the part in a controlled, straight line. Manual breaking tools are provided to perform the break after scribing. 
Can scribe/break ~350µm thick sapphire wafers. Thicker/more difficult to cleave parts should be thinned down on the [Allied Polisher](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Mechanical_Polisher_\(Allied\) ""Mechanical Polisher \(Allied\)"") before cleaving. 
## Detailed Specifications
  * Wafer/Parts Sizes: 4"" down to ~10mm
  * Digital microscope w/ laptop for finer alignment
  * ~100µm alignment accuracy

Wafer Cleaver Recipes (LSD-155LT),https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wafer_Cleaver_Recipes_(LSD-155LT),"The following table is a good starting point for several materials where users were able to successfully cleaved their samples. There are 3 modes of operations: Scribe and Break, Notch and Break and Notch and Drop. One will need to consider what is the best operating mode for their samples. Notch and Drop has the advantage of not having the wheel roll over the top of your sample. Although one can also insert a mylar film on the sample to protect from the rolling wheel. 
Materials  | Material thickness (um)  | Operating mode  | Scribe Pressure (psi)  | Wheel Pressure (psi)  | Comments   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
GaAs  | 125 to 675  | Scribe & Break and Notch & Cleave  | 9 to 12  | 0.7 to 1.1  | Typically thicker materials will require higher wheel pressure to break   
InP  | 150 to 560  | Scribe & Break and Notch & Cleave  | 6 to 8  | 0.5 to 0.8  | InP is more brittle and should require less break pressure than GaAs   
Si  | 130 to 500  | Scribe & Break and Notch & Cleave  | 9 to 12  | 0.8 to 1.2  | Thicker Si will need higher scribe and wheel pressures   
InGaAs  | 250 to 500  | Scribe & Break and Notch & Cleave  | 6 to 8  | 0.8 to 1.2  |   
InSb  | 500  | Scribe & Break and Notch & Cleave  | 7 to 12  | 0.8  | There is less data on this material

## Wafers to Use
The wafers for process calibration are ordered from a wafer supplier that sells high grade, quality wafers. these are 4""Si wafers, with low particle count (Particles: <=10 @ >=0.3 microns). Wafers should be handled carefully, because every loading and unloading will add some particulates. 
Surfscan 6200 (located in bay5) is used for scanning wafers. There are two standard recipes that could be used for scanning wafers: UCSBTEST1 (for scanning 8” wafers) and UCSBTEST2 (for scanning 4""wafers). The recipe UCSBTEST2 is used as a template to create other two standard recipes: ""UCSB Gain4"" (measuring small particles 0.16-1.6um) and ""UCSB Gain2"" (measuring larger particles 1.6-28um). 
We have cassettes only for 4"" and 8"" wafers. If you plan to scan wafers that have different size, you need to provide your own cassette and calibrate it. If you need to scan wafer pieces, you need to develop your own procedure how to scan it. 
## Scanning procedure for 4"" Si wafers
### Scan before process calibration
  1. Log in (access code is boss)
  2. Load wafers (face up) to the cassette that says "" SURFSCAN"" .
  3. Place the cassette with wafers to the right indexer.
  4. In the menu option select ""CAS"" (this will read all wafers that are in the carrier).
  5. Go to ""Recipes""
  6. Select one of the recipes: 
     * UCSB Gain4 (measuring small particles 0.16-1.6um)
     * UCSB Gain2 (measuring larger particles 1.6-28um) 
       * (Recipe ""UCSBTEST2"" is used as a template to create recipes UCSB Gain2 and UCSB Gain4)
  7. View the recipe and modify it if needed ( if recipe modified, select bin split/default to save changes).
  8. Select the wafer in catalog box you want to scan (you can select one wafer or you can scan all wafers-AUTO option).
  9. Select START.
  10. Wait until scan is finished.
  11. Record: 
     * **LPD Cnt** (sum of all particles #1- #8), particles #1(0.160-0.213)um, particles #8(1.20-1.60)um
     * **Haze** (region(%), average(ppm), peak(ppm)).
  12. Take a picture of the scan (by phone).
  13. Select ""Home"" so indexer moves up to loading/unloading position.
  14. Unload wafers.
  15. Log out.


### Scan after process calibration
Repeat the same procedure as it was done before process calibration.

### Wafer Coating Process traveler
#### Test run on ""dummy wafer""
  * Sometimes a deposited film on the first wafer, after seasoning, might have high particle count. It is recommended to run the process on a dummy wafer to catch the particle, before the run on ""real wafer"". Here are the process instructions:
  * Prepare three 4"" Si wafers : for seasoning, deposition (use one of previously scanned Si wafers) and cleaning.
  * Load wafers in a cassette, making sure major flat is facing outside (toward you). Try to align flats for all three wafers.
  * Load/Edit/Verify standard recipes (for seasoning, deposition, and cleaning). You can change ONLY the time in recipes.
  * Example of how to run process for the standard recipe ""SiO2 LDR 250°C"" 
    * Load seasoning recipe "" SiO2 seasoning"" , time=2min
    * Load deposition recipe ""SiO2 LDR 250°C"" , time=780 sec
    * Load cleaning recipe ""Post dep PD"", t=900sec
  * Run the process
  * Unload the wafers once the process is finished
  * Check the particle count on a wafer with SiO2 film 
    * If the particle count is normal (LPD<500), you can proceed to your process on ""real wafers"".
    * If the particle count is high (scan looks bad), you could run longer clean and try again. If the particle count is still high, please contact the tool owner.


#### Run on ""real wafer""
  * This tool requires : seasoning, deposition and cleaning for each film you want to deposit.
  * There is a seasoning recipe for both nitrides (SiN Seasoning, t=5min), and a seasoning recipe for both oxides (SiO2 seasoning, t=2min)) 
    * The goal of seasoning step is to prepare the chamber for deposition (deposit ~200nm of film on walls).


  * There are standard recipes for deposition:

## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

## Wafers to Use
The wafers for process calibration are ordered from a wafer supplier that sells high grade, quality wafers. These are 4-inch Si wafers, with low particle count (Particles: <=10 @ >=0.3 microns). Wafers should be handled carefully, because every loading and unloading will add some particulates. 
Regular Prime grade wafers also work well, but note that initial pre-process particle measurement may be higher - this is ok as long as you measure _before_ the process step, and subtract that value from the _after_ process value. If your _before_ measurement shows high (eg. >200 particles), do not use that wafer for particle checks, discard it and find a better wafer. 
Surfscan 6200 (located in bay5) is used for scanning wafers. There are two standard recipes that could be used for scanning wafers: UCSBTEST1 (for scanning 8” wafers) and UCSBTEST2 (for scanning 4""wafers). The recipe UCSBTEST2 is used as a template to create other two standard recipes: ""UCSB Gain4"" (measuring small particles 0.16-1.6um) and ""UCSB Gain2"" (measuring larger particles 1.6-28um). 
We have cassettes only for 4"", 6"" and 8"" wafers. If you plan to scan wafers that have different size, you need to provide your own cassette and calibrate it. If you need to scan wafer pieces, you need to develop your own procedure how to scan it. 
## Scanning procedure for 4"" Si wafers
The **right-cassette/indexer** is calibrated for 4-inch and 6-inch Si wafers. The **left-cassette/indexer** is available for 8inch Si wafers (not calibrated). 
### Scan before process step
  1. Log in (access code is boss)
  2. Load wafers (face up) to the cassette that says "" 4inch Surfscan""
  3. Place the cassette with wafers to the right indexer
  4. In the menu option select ""CASS"" (this will read all wafers that are loaded into the cassette)
  5. Go to ""Recipes""
  6. Select one of the recipes: 
     * UCSB G4 0.16-1.6 (measuring small particles 0.16-1.6um)
     * UCSB G2 1.6-28.0 (measuring larger particles 1.6-28um) 
       * Recipe ""UCSBTEST2"" is used as a template to create recipes UCSB Gain2 and UCSB Gain4
  7. View the recipe and modify it if needed (if recipe is modified, select bin split/default to save changes)
  8. Select the wafer in the catalog box you want to scan, and press START (it would scan only one wafer)
  9. Select AUTO option If you want to scan all wafers in the catalog box, followed by START
  10. Wait until scan is finished
  11. Record: 
     * **LPD Cnt** (sum of all particles #1- #8), particles #1(0.160-0.213)um, particles #8(1.20-1.60)um
     * **Haze** (region(%), average(ppm), peak(ppm))
  12. Take a picture of the scan (by phone)
  13. Select ""Home"" so indexer moves up to loading/unloading position
  14. Unload wafers
  15. Log out


#### Data Recording
  * Run the above process TWICE: once for recipe ""Gain 2"" (sizes 1.6µm to 28µm) and another for recipe ""Gain 4"" (sizes 0.160µm to 1.6µm)
  * Record the following: 
    * ""total particle count"",
    * ""Haze %"" and
    * _Take photos of the results screen_ showing all binning and wafer particle distribution. See example photos below.

[![Photo of Surfscan screen showing low particles on wafer.](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/9/95/Surfscan_G4_before_example_-_P1_230317E7G4_before.jpg/381px-Surfscan_G4_before_example_-_P1_230317E7G4_before.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Surfscan_G4_before_example_-_P1_230317E7G4_before.jpg)Typical ""before"" process step Surfscan measurement. A std. Prime Grade Silicon wafer may have 50-100 particles out of the cassette. Note the tweezer pickup location, on the bottom in this photo.
### Perform process step
  * Run the deposition or other process on your wafer.
  * Be careful of adding particles during handling - eg. don't leave wafer out on table unnecessarily, keep it in the case and do not agitate the wafer in the case.


### Scan after process calibration
  * Repeat the same procedure above for scanning.
  * Subtract pre-scan particle counts, to remove pre-process particles that were already on the wafer.


### Example Surfscan photos
#### Low particle example
Here are two example photos for UCSB Gain4, and UCSB Gain2 recipes, showing acceptable particle levels:

Gas inlet showerhead pattern is seen, suggesting the source of the particles.
  

## Plotting Process Control Data
Make an Excel spreadsheet. Enter information for Gain4 and Gain2 (particles#1, particles#8, LPD, haze) before and after deposition. For each gain calculate Delta (LPDad - LPDbd). Make a plot (Particulates vs. Date). 
Example :

## Surfscan additional information
### Introduction
Surfscan 6200 locates, sizes, and counts defects in semiconductor substrate material down to 0.157um at a 95% capture rate and down to 0.09um at an 80% capture rate. The instrument uses laser beam scanning for detecting defect contamination and displays scan results in color-coded wafer maps, histograms, and summaries. The instrument scans wafers contained in a cassette. Cassettes can be loaded onto the left indexer, right indexer, or both indexers. Cassette configuration can be ( R only, L only, Right to left, Left to right, Sort wafers). When manually aligning wafers, one of the flats of each wafer should face the front of the cassette. When using a mechanical aligner, the flats should face the rear of the cassette. If wafers get scratched, damaged or mishandled immediately perform cassette calibration. The instrument communicates with an operator using the Microsoft Windows. To use an application, choose menus or commands displayed in the menu bar, or use keypad commands. The system menu is an icon-based menu. Double click on the application icon to start an application. In the Scan window , the menu bar displays: ID, CASS, AUTO, HOME, SAVE, and PRINT commands. 
### Basic skills
This chapter describes instrument controls, including keypad, mouse, floppy drive, and cassette indexer. This chapter also describes how to load a cassette and introduces you to basic program operation using the mouse or keypad. 
### Getting started
This chapter provides basic startup procedures for the instrument, including: (Powering up the instrument , Logging on to the instrument , Starting Scan , Quitting from an application, Logging off the system, Setting up the system for first use, Using the DOS shell (advanced use), Monitoring disk and database space) 
Log in, access code is boss. 
Double click on the icon of the application to start application. 
Log off the system, to exit the current application. 
The Tencor Instrument banner at the top of the screen contains a disk status. If it is green the database space is available. If it is yellow, free disk or data space is getting low, so it needs to be increased free space. It is red, there is no free space. 
### Scanning
#### Start the scan application
  * At the System Menu, choose the Scan icon. A blank Scan window appears. The Scan window is divided into areas that display results of scans.The Scan window displays the recipe name in the title bar and the scan sequence in the status box. Scan sequence indicates the order in which slots are scanned: from top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top.
  * Choose the recipe to be used
  * Load the cassette of substrates onto the right locator
  * Choose scan options
  * Enter a Lot ID, if desired


#### Scanning methods
This section describes scanning methods. The procedure describes how to scan all substrates, selected substrates, or one substrate from a cassette(called direct access). The table at the end of this section tells you where to go in this manual to use advanced scan features and options. The recipe sets the primary data of interest (defect or haze) and the initial data displays (map or histogram or both). For each scan, the instrument displays the primary data and lists the results of the scan in the summary. If the recipe specifies alternate data, the data can be manually chosen for display. The recipe also can specify automatic saving or printing of data. When the last substrate in the cassette is scanned or when you press HOME, the instrument homes the cassette and displays the Lot Summary window. (The Lot Summary screen does not appear if Suppress Lot Summary Display is enabled in the User Configuration dialog box.) The Cassette catalog lists the occupied slots of the cassette. The catalog can be numbered from bottom-to-top (the default) or top-to-bottom and the scanning sequence can be set to bottom-to-top or top-to-bottom. 
Scanning options are: automatic or manual operation, scan sequence, and microscope hold for MicroViewing. 
#### Using the scan window
When you scan a substrate, the instrument displays the results in the scan summary. Depending upon recipe settings, the instrument also displays scan results in a map, histogram, or both. Data are color-coded as shown by the bin splits in the summary. The cassette catalog displays the contents of the cassette and can be used to select individual substrates for scanning. The Scan window contains the following areas: summary box, wafer map, cassette catalog, histogram, and status box. In the Scan menu bar, choosing ID, Cass, Start, Auto, Home, or Save is the same as pressing the key of the same name on the instrument keypad. Recipe, XY, Print, and Display are pull-down menus. 
_The Recipe menu_ allows you to load a new recipe, view and modify the current recipe, create a new recipe, save a recipe, set user IDs, delete a recipe, enter the Lot ID, extend the puck for inspection and cleaning, and exit the Scan application. For details on recipes, see Chapter 5, “Recipes.” _The Print menu_ allows you to print wafer summaries and lot summaries on the text printer. Summaries can be printed in 40, 80, or 132 column format. The Select Printers item allows you to select the text and graphics printers for the system. The Resume Printer item starts a suspended print job. See Section 4.11, “Printing Summaries,” for details on printing. _The Display menu_ provides data display combinations: defect map only, defect histogram only, defect map plus histogram, haze map only, haze histogram only, or haze map plus histogram. The recipe specifies the initial data display. _The Help menu_ provides help topics. Choose Using Scan to view the help topics related to the Scan application or choose Contents to open the help system. Choosing Using Help displays the Microsoft Windows Using Help topics. 
#### Using the summary box
The summary displays the date and time of the scan, the results of the scan, bin splits, overlay controls, and a selection of recipe parameters. The bin splits are color-coded, as shown by the numbered buttons. You can enable or disable a bin from the map or histogram by selecting a bin split button. The summary updates when you enable or disable a bin split, edit a defect or haze bin, or magnify the map. Buttons 1 through 8 control the bin splits for the primary data. Button 0 overlays the alternate data. Button 9 overlays area data. For example, all haze data can be overlayed onto a defect map by selecting button 0. The summary lists primary data and alternate data (if one is selected in the recipe). 
The recipe sets: Primary data of interest (defect or haze); Initial data displays (map or histogram or both). 
To add the comment in the summary screen, press the minus key on the keypad or the minus button (Top left corner) 
##### Data from summary box
  * LPD Cnt - the total of all light point defects and their total surface area


  * Bins (1-8) - Bin splits intervals and the count of LPDs for each bin
  * Mean (T) - the mean of collected LPDS
  * Std Dev - the standard deviation of collected LPDs
  * Area Cnt –The count of all areas (areas and scratches) on the substrate and the their total surface area
  * Scratch Cnt-The total number of scratches and their total surface area
  * Sum of All Defects-The sum of all LPDs and areas, including scratches
  * Haze Region-The percentage of the measurable surface area containing haze
  * Haze average- The sum of all haze values divided by the number of haze values, including those that are over the Haze Range limit and under the Haze From limit. When the haze map is zoomed, only those haze values in the magnified map are included in the average, including values under or over the haze range limits. When the haze histogram is zoomed, only those haze values within in the zoomed histogram interval are included in the haze average. Values under or over the haze range limits are not included.
  * Haze peak - The highest haze value


##### Using the cassette catalog
The Scan application displays the _**Cassette catalog**_ at the right of the screen. To display the contents of the cassette loaded on the indexer, press CASS. The Cassette catalog displays the cassette’s substrate status, as follows: 
  * If the status of a slot cannot be determined, the slot contains a question mark (?).
  * A white slot number indicates that the substrate has not yet been scanned.
  * A green slot number indicates that the substrate has been scanned and has passed all pass/fail criteria.
  * A red slot number indicates that the substrate has been scanned and has failed one or more pass/fail criteria.
  * A yellow slot number indicates that the instrument is processing the substrate.


##### Using the histogram
The histogram displays the distribution of light point defects or haze values. The color coding corresponds to the bin splits shown in the summary. Using the histogram window, you can zoom the histogram and change bin splits. A LPD histogram plots the LPD count versus LPD diameter or cross-section as specified in the recipe. A haze histogram plots the number of defects versus haze values. Defect histograms display a red total area bar at the right. 
There are options as: 1) Zoom the histogram (allowing you to narrow the data range); 2) Edit the bin split (the histogram can be used to change LPD bin splits). 
##### Using the wafer mapper
The Scan application can display a wafer map of LPDs or haze. The wafer map can be displayed in combination with a histogram. The recipe sets the initial substrate map/ histogram display combination and the combination can be changed for the current scan by using the Display menu. 
##### Zooming the map
The instrument provides a multilevel zoom feature. When you zoom the map, the instrument displays a panning window and magnifies the map. The menu bar lists the instrument keys that can be used when zooming. 
##### Examining a microview
The Surfscan 6000-series MicroView feature allows you to examine a three dimensional representation of the surface of the substrate. The amplitude axis (Z-axis) is evenly scaled from the smallest to largest amplitudes in the MicroView area. 
You can view the MicroView area from different angles, display the MicroView in color or wireframe format, and use the MicroView cursor to obtain approximate defect amplitude or sizing. Also, you can change the threshold level. A MicroView removes the haze data and sizing information is given in approximate diameter or cross section units. 
### Recipes
Recipes allow you to specify data collection, data display, configuration, pass/fail sort settings, and automatic saving and printing operations for a given wafer substrate size and type. To create a new recipe or modify an existing recipe, you must know how to use Recipe menus and the Recipe dialog box, and know how to set recipe parameters. Also, your user account must allow you to create, edit, and save recipes. The instrument stores recipes in the database by name. A recipe name can be up to 19 characters long and can contain any combination of alphabetic, numeric, or special characters. When you load a recipe from the database, the recipe becomes the current recipe, or the recipe used for scanning. Scan and Setup application windows display the current recipe name in parentheses in their title bars, and the Recipe dialog box displays the current recipe name as its title in parentheses. For step-by-step instructions on setting recipe parameters, see Section 5.3.5, “Selecting Substrate Parameters.” Recipe actions are available from the following applications: 
SCAN or SETUP application - to create, 
DATABASE Export/Import utility - to export or import recipes 
DATABASE Reports utility - to print a recipe listing 
#### Recipe menus
Recipe menus in the Scan and Setup applications provide recipe actions: 
  * Load - Open and load a selected recipe. Displays the recipe selection dialog box.
  * View/Modify – View or change the current recipe. Displays the Recipe dialog box.
  * New - Create a new recipe. Displays the New Name dialog box. Type the recipe name and choose OK. The instrument sets initial data collection, data display (except haze range and haze from), and configuration values to the previous recipe’s values. The instrument sets haze display and sort parameters to maximum values. Use View/Modify to change recipe settings.
  * Save- save the recipe using the current recipe name
  * Save as- Save the current recipe using a new name. Displays the New Name dialog box
  * Delete- Delete a selected recipe. Displays the selection dialog box.


#### Using the recipe dialog box
A recipe can be created, modified, or viewed by opening the Recipe dialog box from the Scan or Setup applications. The dialog box contains four general parameter areas: data collection, data display, configuration, and sort. 
#### Recipe parameters
This section describes the parameters listed in the Recipe dialog box. 
[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/2/28/Recipe_parameters.jpg/560px-Recipe_parameters.jpg)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Recipe_parameters.jpg)Recipe Dialog Box
###### Data collection parameters
1) _Substrate diameter_ (wafers 2-8""); 2) _Edge exclusio_ n (the distance from the edge of the wafer toward the center that is excluded from scan results. Minimum value is 1 mm. Maximum value is one-half wafer diameter); 3) _Flat/Notch exclusion_ (This is the wafer exclusion pattern to apply. One or more exclusion regions can be defined by the exclusion patterns listed in this field. The areas of the wafer specified by exclusion regions are excluded from scan results. See Section 9.5, “Defining Exclusion Patterns,” for details); 4) _Haze Suppression_ (Increases the Haze Range and Haze From by the value entered); 5) _Gain/Max Size_ ( Gain determines the range of data collected during a scan. Gain is a value from 1- 8 for the Surfscan 6200. Max Size indicates the maximum LPD size for this gain. When you change Gain, the instrument automatically sets Area From to Max Size, and sets Threshold and Haze Range to their default values); 6) _Threshold_ (Threshold specifies the smallest LPD size to be included in the scan result. Threshold defaults to the standard value for the current gain setting. If you set threshold to 0, the instrument automatically supplies the default value. If you set threshold to a value equal to or greater than Max Size, data will be collected for one size only); 7) _Throughput_ (The speed at which the wafer is processed through the instrument: high, medium, normal, or low). 
To learn more about Gain/Max size and Threshold values read in [Operation-Manual.pdf](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/9/96/Surfscan-Operation-Manual.pdf). 
###### Data display parameters
Data display parameters specify the primary and secondary data, type of display (map, histogram, or both), show size (diameter or cross section), bin splits, area boundary, and haze range. 1) _Display option_ (this is data to collect, display, and save. _Defect/Haze_ : the instrument collects defect and haze data and displays defect data when the scan completes. Haze data can be overlaid by selecting the summary table 0 button. _Haze/Defect_ : the instrument collects defect and haze data and displays haze data when the scan completes. Defect data can be overlaid by selecting the summary table 0 button. _Defects Only_ : the instrument collects, displays, and saves defect data only. _Haze Only_ : the instrument collects, displays, and saves haze data only); 2) _Display Type_ ( shows the initial map and histogram display combination); 3) _Show_ (LPD size calculation and display parameter: diameter (µm) or cross section (µm2 )); 3) _Bin Split_ (Bin split value indicates number of bins used. The Bin Split dialog box allows you to edit LPD bin split ranges and to set the number of bins used); 4) _Area From_ (This value determines the LPD size above which the instrument classifies LPDs as areas. Defaults to the current Max Size value. Maximum diameter is 9900 µm and maximum cross section is 99000 µm2 ); 5) _Haze Range_ (Limited, full, extended or autorange. The haze value range, in parts-per-million, are determined by the current gain setting. In autorange, the instrument chooses the range that provides the best resolution. The instrument automatically zooms on the peak of the data, if any); 6) _Haze From_ (The minimum haze value collected. Defaults to 1/250 of the Haze Range value). 
###### Configuration parameters
Configuration parameters provide cassette, sorting, automatic operation, and substrate selection( type and thickness). 1) _Cassette_ (describes cassette type and wafer handling configuration); 2)_Sorting_ (Off); 3) _Auto Align [x-y]_(Off); 4)_Auto Gain Setting_ (Off); 4) _Auto Print_ (Off); 5) _Auto Save_ (Off); 6) _Substrate name_ (describes calibrated substrate type and thickness. To select a substrate type, choose the SEL button. The dialog box lists the substrate types and thicknesses currently available. Use the cycle control to select an available film thickness. (T) = Tencor-supplied calibration curve (C) = customer-supplied calibration curve). 
###### Sort parameters
Establish the pass/fail limits for wafers. If scan results exceed any of the enabled sort parameters in the recipe, the wafer fails, otherwise the wafer passes. Certain recipe parameters interact. When you change Gain, for example, Threshold, Area From, and Haze Range values automatically change to the default values for that gain. You can change the values for these parameters after setting the gain. 1) LPD Count (The maximum number of light particle defects (LPD) allowed: 0 to 99999); 2) _LPD/cm2_ (Number of light particle defects allowed per square centimeter. Defaults to measurable wafer surface area / total LPD); 3) _Bin limit_ (Off or On. Set to On to use the bin limits specified in the Bin Limit dialog box.

###### Selecting substrate parameters
Setting recipe parameters starts with selecting substrate parameters. A recipe specifies the diameter and edge exclusion for the substrate, and specifies which substrate/film thickness calibration curve to use for calculating LPD sizes. The instrument collects data only from within the measurable surface area of a wafer. 
Choose the select button at the bottom-left of the Recipe dialog box. The dialog box lists all substrates and thicknesses currently calibrated for the instrument. If the substrate you want is not listed, you can calibrate the instrument for the new substrate. See Chapter 7, “Calibration"" in [Operation-Manual.](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/images/9/96/Surfscan-Operation-Manual.pdf)
When a Tencor Instruments-supplied calibration curve is used, the substrate name is followed by (T) in the Recipe dialog box. When a customer-supplied calibration curve is used, the substrate name is followed by (C) in the Recipe dialog box. The (T) or (C) designation also is shown in the wafer summary in the Mean field. To use the recipe limits used when calibrating for the film and thickness specified, check the Recipe Limits from Calibration Curve check box. 
#### Setting the data collection range
This section tells you how to obtain the desired data collection range by selecting instrument gain, threshold, the defect-to-area boundary, and haze range for a recipe. 
The instrument collects _defect_ and _haze_ data from a wafer by illuminating the wafer surface with a laser beam, collecting the scattered light through an optics system, and amplifying the scattered light with a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The gain of the PMT determines the dynamic range for collecting data. 
##### Selecting an LPD range
To specify the light point defect (LPD) range, use Gain, Threshold, and Area From parameters. The _Gain_ setting determines the maximum LPD size of interest (the Max Size recipe parameter). _Threshold_ determines the smallest LPD collected during a scan and can be adjusted as necessary to isolate a particular LPD range. The _Area From_ parameter determines the LPD size at which the instrument classifies _areas_. The instrument classifies LPDs at or above the Area From value as an area. Area From defaults to Max Size (Fig. 5-6) but can be increased if necessary (Fig. 5-7). Using a combination of gain and threshold settings, you can scan for a broad or narrow band of LPDs, depending upon your requirements. The instrument collects, displays, and records LPDs within the range set by the Threshold and Area From parameters. 
  * _Threshold_ =Min Size Particles (bin#1)
  * _Max Size_ = Max Size Particles (bin#8)
  * _Area From_ defaults to Max Size
  * _Area_ = determines LPDs above ""Area from""
  * True Dynamic Range= LPDs that are collected

[![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/e/e7/LPD_Ranges.png/486px-LPD_Ranges.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:LPD_Ranges.png) [![](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/w/images/thumb/f/f3/Area_from_Equals_Max_size.png/489px-Area_from_Equals_Max_size.png)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/File:Area_from_Equals_Max_size.png)
##### Selecting a Haze range
The haze range collected during a scan is determined by the gain setting, Haze Range value, and Haze From value. Haze Range determines the maximum haze value collected during a scan. You can select from the three haze ranges for each gain setting (full, limited, extended)., or choose the Autorange setting (the instrument chooses the range that provides the best resolution). 
Example: 1) Gain2 [haze range (extended) is set to (39.2–10000)ppm]; 2) Gain4 [haze range (extended) is set to (1.96–500)ppm] 
Haze From is the smallest haze value collected. Haze From defaults to 1/250 the current Haze Range setting but can be set to a different value, as needed. During a scan, the instrument collects haze data from the measurable wafer surface, separated into 832 x 860-µm segments called tiles. Haze maps display the average haze value per tile. Haze histograms display the distribution of haze values. Average haze for a wafer is calculated by averaging the haze values of all tiles on the wafer. 
###### What is ""Haze""?
Haze is a measure of the light scattered off of a surface. Lower roughness translates into less scattered light and a lower haze. Residual particles scatter light and also increase haze. 
For example, surface roughness, or high-density particulates that are smaller than the tool detection limit could be included as ""Haze"". 
Typical haze values are less than 0.1 ppm in the narrow normal channel for a highly polished, reflective surface. 
##### Selecting throughput
Throughput (low, normal, medium and high) affects the wafer processing speed, relative instrument sensitivity, and microscan viewing area dimensions. Low throughput results in highest instrument sensitivity,. but produces the lowest wafer-per-hour processing speed. In general, use the highest throughput that produces acceptable results. 
#### Selecting display options
This section describes _defect_ and _haze_ display options. The recipe specifies which types of data will be collected during a scan, how to display data in the Scan window (wafer map, histogram, or both), the LPD size calculation method (LPD cross section in µm2 or LPD diameter in µm), defect bin splits, haze bin splits, and initial area and scratch display. 
##### Selecting the data display
The options are: 1) _Defect/Haze_ , 2) Haze/Defect, 3) Defect only, 4) Haze only. 
_Defect /Haze_ (The instrument collects all data and displays defect data in maps and histograms. Haze data can be displayed in the wafer map by using the 0 button in the summary table or haze data can be chosen for display through the Display menu). 
##### Displaying defects
###### Light point defects
The instrument color-codes LPD bin splits. You can set the number of LPD bin splits by setting the recipe Bin Split parameter. The following rules apply to setting bin splits: 
  * The number of LPD bins can be from one to eight.
  * All bins must be within the data collection range displayed at the bottom of the dialog box.
  * Each bin represents a separate range of values. Bins cannot overlap.
  * The value of the lower boundary of a bin defaults to the value of the upper boundary of the previous bin (For example, if the upper boundary of bin #2 is set to 0.379, the lower boundary of bin #3 is automatically set to 0.379. The lower boundary of bins cannot be set directly).


  * The Area From value defaults to the Max Size value, but can be changed. When Area From exceeds Max Size, the LPD range is extended to the Area From value, and the ranges of LPD bins and bin split limits are adjusted, as necessary.


###### Areas and scratches
The instrument classifies a defect larger than the recipe Area From value as _an area_ or as _a scratch_. Areas are displayed as red regions on wafer maps. The total surface area occupied by areas is shown by a red vertical bar in histograms. The instrument estimates the size of an area by totaling the length of all chords recorded for the area. The instrument defines a scratch as an area that when an ellipse is drawn around the area. 
• The length of the major axis of the ellipse is equal to or greater than the Scratch Minimum Length value specified in the User Configuration dialog box. 
• The ratio of the major axis of the ellipse to the estimated width must be equal to or greater than the Scratch Length To Width Ratio value specified in the Detailed Scratch Definition dialog box. The instrument estimates width by dividing the area by the length of the major axis of the ellipse. 
• The ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of the ellipse must be equal to or greater than three. The instrument reports scratch count and area total in the wafer summary table. 
###### Displaying haze
When the Display Option parameter is set to _Haze/Defect_ or _Haze Only_ , haze is the primary data. The instrument automatically displays haze data in the Scan window for each wafer scan. When Display Option is set to Defect/Haze, haze is the secondary data. The instrument collects haze data which can be displayed by choosing a haze display option from the Display menu. The instrument color-codes haze data. Each color identifies a separate range of data, called a bin split. Haze bin splits can be edited through the Detailed Haze Bin Split dialog box. 
#### Selecting Automatic Operations
This section describes the automatic operations available through a recipe, including 
  * Automatic sorting of failed wafers to the left cassette
  * Automatic alignment of the wafer to a feature
  * Automatic printing of summaries or the screen
  * Automatic saving of summaries or wafer maps


#### Selecting sort options
Recipe sort parameters determine when a wafer passes or fails the scan. Limits can be set for total number of defects found, defects/cm2 , LPDs per bin, area count, scratch count, area total, scratch length total, haze as a percentage of total measurable wafer area, average haze, and peak haze. A wafer passes when data does not exceed any limits that are On. 
#### Recipe parameters guidelines
  * Area Total should be less than 10 mm2 for a 150-mm wafer. Adjust range using Gain and Threshold parameters to reduce total area.
  * If the instrument displays Data Overload in the status box, instrument sensitivity is too high. Count accuracy and repeatability might not be reliable. Reduce sensitivity by raising threshold, reducing gain, or increasing throughput.
  * If the histogram shows an exponentially increasing distribution at the low end of the graph, the instrument might be collecting phantom defects or haze noise. Raise threshold and gain proportionately.

### Detailed Specifications
The following equipment is provided at this bench for various types of electroplating. 
  * DC/Pulsed Power supply
  * Hotplate / Stirrer
  * Cables/electrodes
  * Chemistry hardware for suspending thermocouples, electrodes and samples in beakers.


Users must provide the following: 
  * Beakers for chemicals
  * Chemistry for performing the electroplating. [See this FAQ page](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Bring_a_new_chemical.2Fmaterial_into_the_lab ""Frequently Asked Questions"") for info on supplied chemicals and bringing new chemicals.
  * Other ancillary hardware (tweezers, cases etc.)  



## Automated Wet-processing Spinners (POLOS)
### General Information
The POLOS spinners, installed on various Solvent, Acid/Base and Develop benches, allow for wafer spinning while applying wet chemistry. Users may program the spinners with custom programs. 
### Develop Bench POLOS Spinners
These POLOS spinners are hooked up to pressurized vessels for developer chemicals, and have closed lids with nozzles for fluid/nitrogen delivery. This enables automated spray/puddle developing. In addition, users can spin-drying after manual development. - especially helpful for larger wafers (eg. 100mm) which are more difficult to dry by hand. 
### Solvent Bench POLOS Spinners
These spinners are uncovered, allowing users to use our solvent squirt bottles & nitrogen guns for cleaning samples while spinning, which improves wafer cleanliness considerably. Several non-contact chucks for 100mm and 150mm wafers are available, which makes solvent cleaning the underside of these wafers especially useful and effective, without affecting any top-side photoresist, lithography or patterning.

## Organic removal
### Piranha Solution
  * **Careful!** Read about how to prepare and handle this safely: 
    * Used for etching away Photoresist residues after dry etching.


### PureStrip (Transene)
  * Heat to @ 70°C 
    * [Vertical heated bath on Wafer Toxic-Corrosive bench in Bay 4](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Wet_Benches#Wafer_Toxic_Corrosive_Benches ""Wet Benches"")
    * After a few days heated, it loses potency - must drain + replenish with fresh solution.
    * ~30-90min will remove stubborn, microscopic PR residues from dry etching.


## [Gold Plating Bench (Technic SEMCON 1000)](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Gold_Plating_Bench ""Gold Plating Bench"")
Standard plating recipes are described and taught during the equipment training for this tool. 
Electroplating first requires a Gold seed layer to be present on all surfaces to be plated. Common ways to produce this are to: 
  * [Sputter-coat](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Tool_List#Sputter_Deposition ""Tool List"") a thin (~10nm) Au layer on all surfaces of the wafer, being careful to consider shadowing effects during the dep (eg. in high-aspect ratio trenches).
  * Perform photolithography to protect (and prevent plating) in desired areas - areas with no photoresist will be plated.
  * Perform the electroplating on the [Technic SemCon](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/Gold_Plating_Bench ""Gold Plating Bench""), contacting the seed layer with electrodes and executing the program for the desired current/time to achieve the plating thickness (typically microns).
  * Strip the photoresist using standard solvents.
  * Use the [Oxford Ion Mill](https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/CAIBE_\(Oxford_Ion_Mill\) ""CAIBE \(Oxford Ion Mill\)"") to blanket etch the 10nm seed layer all over the wafer (the 10nm removed from the plated regions will be negligible).

## About
The applications of this tool are mainly in MEMS-device fabrication areas (releasing a MEMS structure by etching a sacrificial layer below), in which Si or Ge or even some metals, such as Mo, can be isotropically dry etched using gaseous XeF2 (no plasma enhancement or heating is needed) with the use of photoresist or SiO2 or Al as an etch mask at room temperature. 
The XeF2 etch process is a purely chemical one and usually results in a rough etched surface. The tool is operated in a pulsed mode in which the etch chamber is repeatedly filled with XeF2 gas and, then, pumped out (to 0.3 Torr). You can also add N2 gas, together with XeF2 gas, into the etch chamber for some applications. 
There is a microscope attached to this tool, with which you can monitor the etch process of your sample. You can change the number of etch cycles during a run, which will be effective in that run. Also, you can manually stop a run based on microscope observations. 
Maximum Wafer size is 6"". 
For users who want to etch through or very deep into a Si wafer, they should use the Si Deep RIE tool in the lab.

YES-150C-Various-Resists,https://wiki.nanofab.ucsb.edu/wiki/YES-150C-Various-Resists,"Pressure drop indicates completion of etch. 
Once pressure flattens etching is complete. 
There is uncertainty in the exact completion time, somewhere between the peak pressure and the point where it goes flat. Using known PR thicknesses (spun at standard spin speeds - see the [datasheets](https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Lithography_Recipes#PositivePR)) you can estimate etch rate from these plots.
