**Image Overview:**
The image displays a wafer holder designed for securing lab wafers during processing. The holder features several crucial components that facilitate effective sample management and stability.

**Purpose:**
The primary purpose of the wafer holder is to securely position multiple wafers face-down for various fabrication or analysis processes. The design allows for easy insertion and removal of the wafers while ensuring they remain stable during experiments.

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Configuration:** The holder accommodates four wafers, each secured with CuBe clips. This arrangement enables efficient processing of multiple samples simultaneously.
- **Fastening Mechanism:** Each clip is attached to the holder and functions to maintain the wafers in the desired position, minimizing movement and ensuring consistent results.
- **Center Bolt:** A correction note indicates that a 1/4-20 bolt and nut may already be inserted in the center of the holder. This feature likely assists in securing the entire assembly or serves as a reference point for alignment.
- **Materials:** The clips appear to be made from a conductive material—likely copper and beryllium (CuBe)—to prevent contamination while providing conductive properties.

This image serves as a visual reference for lab personnel on how to properly insert wafers and utilize the handling tools for optimal performance."
