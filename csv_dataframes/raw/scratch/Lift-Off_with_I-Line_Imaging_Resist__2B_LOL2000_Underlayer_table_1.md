| Metal Evaporation: eBeam#1 or eBeam#4 Adhesion Layer (Ti, Cr): 5nm Metal Layer (any metal): 100nm | Many common metals (Au, Pt) require the use of an adhesion layer like Ti or Cr, which create an interface between oxide and metal interfaces. For some metals you can omit this, for example Aluminum.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Liftoff: Soak in AZ NMP rinse at 80 C (hot-water bath or hotplate) overnight (>>2hrs)             | Observe every few hours to see if metal has fully lifted off. If you see metal still attached in large (>1cm) areas with photoresist, you need to wait longer. Can optionally speed up by - Soaking for 1hr in NMP, then - Transfer to Fresh NMP @ 70°C Ultrasonic bath for 5 min, then, - ISO beaker in Ultrasonic bath for 1 min, then - DI rinse and N2 Dry |
| Solvent clean: ISO soak 1min, ISO soak (clean beaker) 1min N2 dry on napkin                       | Only move to this step if metal liftoff has completed (PR has fully dissolved everywhere).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
