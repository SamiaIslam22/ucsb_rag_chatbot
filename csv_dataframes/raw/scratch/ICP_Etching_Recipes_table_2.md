| Use POLOS spinners with ACE/ISO to clean front and back of wafer. IMPORTANT for wax-mounting, to ensure wax does not stick your wafer to the DSE clamp. Observe carefully for any wax protruding from between wafers - redo spin-clean as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Also make sure wax thickness is not too thick, of long etches could cause wax to seep out from between the wafers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| DSEiii etch - reduce Dep step to eliminate grassing: Bosch Cycles: Dep: 1.2sec / Etch A: 1.5sec / Etch B: 2.0sec Rate ≈ 4.25µm / min                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Can use Lasermonitor and/or Camera to observe when etch is fully through. Trenches may get black/rough, but then clear up when fully etched. Record Helium FLOW during recipe run, for next step (if He leaks). Ok to remove wafer, observe/measure, and re-load for etching. If see black grass and etch rate drops, may need to run an O2 plasma with Technics PEii few min to remove polymer, Increase EtchA step time (eg. by 50-100%) and then continue the etch. |
| If you did not wax-mount your wafer, the recipe will eventually fail for Helium Pressure/Flow out of compliance. This is because the cooling Helium leaks through the wafer when the openings get fully etched through. Once this happens, Leave your wafer in the chamber, then Edit recipe to set Helium Cooling (first step only) to "Flow Control Only". Set to typical flow of normal process from above (Something like ~6sccm? Not sure. Exact value is not critical) Re-run the recipe with He on Flow-control only until etch is complete. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
